# Public Lab archive

This is a static (read-only) archive of the PublicLab.org website, and is an ongoing project to preserve it as an accessible and free resource. Please see https://github.com/publiclab/publiclab-archive for more.

URLs follow the same format as the original site, but with a "publiclab.org/static/#" prefix; that is:

https://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping

is browseable as:

https://publiclab.org/static/#/wiki/balloon-mapping

This will be adjusted as the effort progresses.

You can also browse it as a GitHub Pages site at:

https://static.publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping
