# March Mapping Madness-Vermont/Northern New England

Planning Page for Vermont/Northern New England Meet up!

Vermont/Northern New England organizers: <a href="http://fastie.net/">Chris Fastie</a> (contact link at bottom of that page) There are about six of us within 75 miles of Middlebury, VT, just the right number for a good mapping session. I have kites, cameras, rigs, etc., and soon a new balloon kit. Let's figure this out together.

Interested in participating:
R.J. Steinert (I live in Somerville but I'm often in Burlington in case there is anything we would be interested in mapping there)
