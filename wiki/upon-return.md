# Upon Return

Upon return from your balloon mapping trip, you'll want to:

* First, select the clearest, most straight down images of your desired area:
  * you can sort them one at a time on your computer, or 
  * have multiple people use [MapMill](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/mapmill) to rank each photo as "Really Good," "Just OK," or "Not Useful." 
* Second, use the [Knitter](http://cartagen.org/maps) or a desktop program like Adobe Photoshop to georectify the images and stitch them into a map.

###Uploading the aerial images###

At this time we are asking users to post their images either on dropbox, or a similar cloud hosting service. Then email [organizers@publiclaboratory.org](mailto:organizers@publiclaboratory.org) once your transfer is complete and send the download link. We'll add your images to the MapMill.org site and you can start sorting.

**It's very helpful if when you submit folders, they are labelled in this format and each set is a single folder containing only JPG images.**

Place pictures in a folder (not zipped, please) named with the date, the site name, and your name, like ’2011-8-15-missisippi-longbeach-jeff’_
