# Barnraising Planning

A page for organizing upcoming barnraisings. 

The next barnraising is the 2014 Barnraising in November: (no wiki page yet)

After the 2012 one, we decided to have committees to co-organize. As the next one approaches, put down your name next to one of the committees to help organize!

Also check out the mailing list: https://groups.google.com/group/plots-barnraising

The committees are:

###Foodcom

###Travelcom

###Schedulecom

###Beercom

(unwinding, downtime)

###Doccom

(tweeting, documenting, reporting out to the online audience as things happen)
