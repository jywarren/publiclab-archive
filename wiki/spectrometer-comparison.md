# Spectrometer comparison

Not sure if this makes sense but I wanted to list a few devices which are similar to the PLOTS spectrometer for comparison of features and price:

$4,000 [Apogee PS-100](http://www.apogeeinstruments.com/spectroradiometer/software.html) - 350-1000nm, lots of software features
