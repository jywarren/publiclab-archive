## How to use this website

If you're coming to Public Lab with an environmental issue or concern, consider starting by posting an Issue Brief. Check out this walkthrough of posting an issue brief to Public Lab:

The website is where our community develops [open-source](/licenses) documentation and literature on DIY community science. **There are three main areas of the site:**

**[Research notes](/research)** are the easiest and best way to share (i.e. open source) your work. [Post a research note](/post) to solicit input, publish tests or prototypes, ask questions, or just to keep track of links and research documents. Posting is like making a blog post in that you get sole authorship credit and only you can edit your notes.

**[Wiki pages](/wiki)** hold our collective knowledge base. Wiki pages feature curated knowledge condensed from work documented on research notes. They can be edited by anyone with a publiclab.org account. 

**[The Archive](/archive)** hosts open data created by Public Lab tools for all to use. Currently featuring maps in visible and infrared, the archive will be expanding to hold spectral, water quality, and other types of data generated by Public Lab tools.
