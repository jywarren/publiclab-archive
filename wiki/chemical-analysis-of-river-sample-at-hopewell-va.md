# CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF RIVER SAMPLE AT HOPEWELL VA

This sample (taken from the Appomattox river) was collected at 9:00 am on 01/14/16. 
Distance from Hercules chemical plant is less than .25 miles. 

Analysis revealed;

1) Aminopyrazole derivatives @ 410.92 nm

2) dipyrrometheneboron difluorides (BDP)

Suspected organophosphates, but I need to fashion a better prep for detection in the sample.

protocol question:
Sampling-Are you sampling upstream of the suspect site to ensure no previous C(ontamination)?
What is your sampling CONTROL?
