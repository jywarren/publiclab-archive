# cooperation

### About

We'd like to use this wiki as a temporary organizing node for materials related to the **Cooperation Working Group** -- a Boston-wide conversation about online peer production, collective action, citizen science, and computer-supported cooperative work.  As our conversations evolve, we hope to engage members from the broader Public Lab community in conversations about facilitating cooperation and collaboration.

The Cooperation Group mailing list (mostly for meet-up announcements) is [here](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/lists/info/cooperation).
