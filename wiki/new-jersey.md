[Sean McGinnis](/profile/SeanKMcGinnis) is New Jersey's main Public Lab organizer. 

Current projects include infrared imaging with the Green Community Garden, part of the Adopt-A-Lot program of the City of Newark's Office of Sustainability. Read more on the [Newark page](http://publiclab.org/wiki/newark).

We've also spoken with some environmental organizations in [Camden, NJ](/wiki/camden), near [Philly](/wiki/philadelphia). 

An early regional project was Grassroots Newark, organized by [Jen Hudon](/profile/Hudonnoodles) in 2011, which focused on development and community issues on both sides of the Passaic River:
