# Locked pages

Locked wiki pages have been made editable only by [moderators](/wiki/moderators) and site admins; please email [moderators@publiclab.org](mailto:moderators@publiclab.org) if you believe a page has been locked in error. Tags cannot be added to locked pages except by moderators and admins.

Additionally, pages can only be locked by moderators or admins. You can tell a page is locked by the lock icon which appears instead of the usual `Edit` button:
