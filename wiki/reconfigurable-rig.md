# Reconfigurable Rig

# Reconfigurable Rig

This aerial photography rig was designed by @Ranon Prichard as an Autodesk Student Expert Intern project funded by [Autodesk](http://www.autodesk.com/).

The goal is to create an affordable yet versatile rig that can be reconfigured in a number of ways for use in [pole](/tag/pole-mapping), [balloon and kite aerial](/wiki/balloon-mapping) photography in several configurations.  The parts are standard hardware store parts and laser cut plywood pieces.

Research notes on the rigs and their usage are tagged [reconfigurable-rig](/tag/Reconfigurable-Rig). Please [post your research.](/post)

The parts, 3D printing and laser cutting files, and assembly instructions are available in the [Reconfigurable Rig Github repository](https://github.com/ranon96/Reconfigurable-Rig).

###About the Development

The rig features a rubber band powered pan mechanism which uses a pipe fitting filled with silly putty as resistance, inspired by a [design](https://billboyheritagesurvey.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/the-simon-harbord-silly-putty-sp-rig/) by Simon Harbord.  More details in [this note.](https://publiclab.org/notes/ranon/06-13-2016/silly-putty-kap-rig).  Electronics free alternatives to the Silly Putty panning mechanism are [explored here](https://publiclab.org/notes/ranon/07-07-2016/electronics-free-automated-pan-mechanisms).

The rig was inspired by [Tinker Toy type connectors](/notes/ranon/06-22-2016/plastic-tubing-oblique-kap-rig), and the use of beverage tubing in [KAPtery rigs](/tag/kaptery).  The use of [cable clamps and 2D parts](/notes/ranon/07-07-2016/reconfigurable-rig) to make Tinker Toy-like pieces enables the parts to be produced via laser cutting for more affordable kits.

More configurations for pole photography are [explored here](/notes/ranon/08-10-2016/reconfigurable-rig-pole-configuration-and-github-repository).
