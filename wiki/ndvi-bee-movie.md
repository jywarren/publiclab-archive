# NDVI Bee Movie

![NDVI.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/000/446/medium/NDVI.png)

Quick conversions of Chris Fastie's [NBG Bee Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzS1zzzFpzU):

- [Bee Movie in NDVI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrfE6A4jLE)

- [Bee Movie in NIR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0QZmk_Hzws)

Used ffmpeg and some python code([on github](https://github.com/dwblair/infrapix-mov) to do it -- not very well documented yet.

Also may have goofed on the algorithm for conversions (the scale on the NDVI seems off); but modulo some tweaks, it seems relatively straightforward to generate NDVI and NIR from most movie formats using ffmpeg and python.
