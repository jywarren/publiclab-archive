# Trees: The effect on climate and air quality

We want to know your temperatures in areas with varying amounts of trees. For example, a city with minimal trees like Syracuse stays below freezing for many months of the year and receives about 1 metre of snow on average, though it can be up to 2, compared to my hometown in New Hampshire where we receive up to 2 metres but have more reasonable temperatures and have many more trees.
