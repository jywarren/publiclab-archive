# Summer of Code

Public Lab has received support for students and other contributors to work on Public Lab software projects via both [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) and [Google's Summer of Code](http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) programs -- 2017 is our fourth great year of open source coding! Also see #gsoc for more.

This is a key way that we are able to develop our collaborative platform (this site) as well as other Public Lab coding projects.
