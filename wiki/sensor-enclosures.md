Environmental sensors that are used outdoors for long periods often need weatherproof or even waterproof enclosures. This page collects resources and projects to protect electronic and other sensors from the elements.

At Public Lab, we emphasize low cost, low complexity tools and techniques, so we're really interested in sensor enclosures that are designed with that in mind -- or that are being designed so!
