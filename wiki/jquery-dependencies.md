# jQuery dependencies

This page is for those of us working on the [development of the PLOTS website](http://github.com/jywarren/plots), and lists the modules which depend on jQuery so that we can get everything working with a more up-to-date version of the library.

* *nivo slider*: front page slideshow
* *jquery sparklines*: "github graphs" on tool pages
* *jquery date picker*: in map node captured_at date input form

Older versions (gotta list generally which versions:)

* *drupal admin interface*
