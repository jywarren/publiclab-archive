# UV Emission Sampling

Several Public Lab members have been experimenting with UV emission spectroscopy.
An [early alpha sampling kit](http://www.publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-04-2014/oil-testing-kit-draft-materials-list) has been [put together](http://www.publiclab.org/notes/mathew/02-22-2014/20-oil-testing-kits-draft-1) and [is for sale](http://store.publiclab.org/products/spectrometry-sampling-kit).
