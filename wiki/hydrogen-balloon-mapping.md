# Hydrogen Balloon Mapping

##Warning: this is purely experimental, can be dangerous, and we do not recommend you try it##

_The notes here are to document our own research in generating hydrogen for use in [balloon mapping](/tool/balloon-mapping)_

We are developing a way to generate hydrogen from **lye** (caustic soda, or drain opener) and **aluminum**. We hope to create plastic packs which can be filled with water and connected to a balloon. The above coffee packages can hold boiling water and are stable and flat-packable. 

More updates soon.
