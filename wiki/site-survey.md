# Survey your site

###About Site Surveys 
A site survey can be any activity that helps you understand your project area more. In site surveys you can collect information by documenting what you see both in a written form, or by using photographs. You can also document information using other senses such as things you hear, feel or smell at a site. Data you collect on site surveys could include:

- weather data, 
- topographical information,
- site features, and
- anything unusual.
 
Site surveys are a great way to help you scope out a new project location. It can help you to:

- Learn about the area,
- Identify questions you're interested in exploring, and
- Think about challenges the site has as it relates to project.
