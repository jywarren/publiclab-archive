# Pollution to Solution

We are students at UMass Amherst conducting research within the 5 Colleges system, using inexpensive technology in a Makerspace setting. My team's research focuses on asthma related pollution in Springfield, MA. We hope to also use inexpensive technology to do research on finding areas in Springfield that have potential for solar and wind development.

We now have access to an arduino and are looking into buying a gas sensor and a rechargeable battery pack to use to measure gas concentrations.
