# mapping curriculum: first flight

*As part of the [Grassroots Mapping Curriculum](/wiki/mapping-curriculum) series.*

Getting started in the field. Quick checklist before going out to do actual field work:
- understanding which materials you would like to use and how they work
- review of all safety matters and regulations
- acceptable weather conditions

The strategy for mapping a particular site will depend on the area of interest. How large is the area? What potential hazards are present, if any?
