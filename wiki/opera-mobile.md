# Opera Mobile

There is an issue affecting Spectral Workbench capture on Android phones in the latest Opera Mobile (v12.1). Opera makes previous versions available at:

ftp://ftp.opera.com/pub/opera/android/mobile/

And you can download version 12.0 here:

###[Android_Opera_Mobile_12_Opera.apk](http://archive.publiclaboratory.org/download/Android_Opera_Mobile_12_Opera.apk)

<hr />

**Details:** the bug caused a download of the web page instead of a page load, and we are still trying to work around it. Check on updates and progress here: https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/issues/138
