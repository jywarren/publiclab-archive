# User interface design

User interface design helps us adapt the systems we use to serve a broad set of interests and backgrounds -- especially this very website. In the spirit of Public Lab collaborative work, this page is for sharing and discussing user interface related information. 

A number of projects are in progress; we work to make sure they are broken into small enough parts so that people can take them on and solve them. Some are listed at the bottom of this page.

## Workflow

We are using this shared [Google Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TCZoTfuhamRVrUak8aDgqJAwSgyhRtZg2Pgacl2_4zc/edit?usp=slides_home&ths=true) to iterate on design solutions, as well as [Froala Design Blocks](https://www.froala.com/design-blocks/) and their [drag and drop editor](https://www.froala.com/design-blocks/webpage-builder) to develop design solutions for these pages. Please [post a proposal or sketch](/post) if you'd like to get involved!

## Resources

### Bootstrap

Our site uses Bootstrap 4 to have a consistent visual style -- it includes ready made buttons, menus, forms, and many other elements. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/

### Icons

On our website, we use Font Awesome icons in version 4.7+ and 5+ -- https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/
