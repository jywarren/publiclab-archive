that local researchers ask and answer their own environmental questions, and use the results to advocate for locally defined social, political, and environmental goals.

 . . . chain of custody . . . transparency . .  etc






###Our process creates good accurate, traceable data.###

###Precision vs. Accuracy###

(use images to help tell this story)
###Calibration###
of tools is crucial to accurate results . . . 

###Aggregation and sharing data improves the results###
