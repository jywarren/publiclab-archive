This page collects research on using #raspberry-pi based cameras (aka #pi-camera) to take [Infragram](/wiki/infragram) multispectral photos, for plant health analysis. It is supported in part by the [AREN project at NASA](/aren). 

## Design goals

Low cost, low complexity, easy to build and open source!

Also see the [Image Sequencer](/image-sequencer) project which is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi for on-board image processing.

To get a kit with this already set up on an SD card and/or Raspberry Pi camera, see:

* [Infragram Pi Camera Kit](https://store.publiclab.org/products/infragram-pi-camera)
* [Pre-flashed SD cards for Raspberry Pi cameras](https://store.publiclab.org/products/pi-builder-cards)

## Quick start

[notes:grid:activity:pi-camera-setup]

If yours is already assembled, just plug it in using a Micro USB cable (or battery pack) and it'll create a WiFi network called `00-PiCamera` -- password `publiclab` -- which you can log into from your phone or laptop. You'll quickly see streaming video, be able to take photos, timelapses, or videos, do motion triggered capture, and more. 


## Questions

Questions can be either frequently asked questions, or "next step" challenges we're looking to solve.
