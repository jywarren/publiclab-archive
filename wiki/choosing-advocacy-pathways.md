# Choosing advocacy pathways

###About Choosing Advocacy Pathways
Community groups facing an environmental concern often need to choose an advocacy strategy. Talking about what has been done in the past, identifying pathways forward, and picking the ones that make the most sense for your group are important step. It is important at this stage for your group to consider all the possibilities, identifying resources you have, and weighing challenges you face.
