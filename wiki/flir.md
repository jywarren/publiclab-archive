# FLIR

FLIR is a company that makes thermal infrared cameras for taking photos or videos of heat (not to be confused with [near infrared cameras](/wiki/multispectral-imaging)). Some of these are tuned specifically for gases, and can be used to image #methane. See more under [thermal photography](/wiki/thermal-photography)
