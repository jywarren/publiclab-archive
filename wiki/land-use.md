# Land use

Gathering information on land-use and how our practices are affecting the places we live and care about is often one of the first steps to understanding an environmental issue. The management practices and modifications we make to the environment have effects not only on the land itself, but often the environmental health of the people nearby and surrounding landscapes.  

Mapping is one of the best methods for understanding current land use practices.  You can read about [mapping methods on this page ](https://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping)
