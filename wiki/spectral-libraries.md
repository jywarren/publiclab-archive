I believe most of these are either for remote sensing or for astronomy, so sample-based spectral libraries may be different:

* HITRAN data for specific molecules: http://archive.publiclaboratory.org/hitran-spectral-library/
* ASTER library for remote sensing/hyperspectral data, mostly land types: http://archive.publiclaboratory.org/aster-spectral-library/
