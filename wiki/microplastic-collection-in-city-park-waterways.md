# Microplastic Collection in City Park waterways

[![IMG-8473.jpg](/i/43819)](/i/43819?s=o)
****
Our goal is to reduce plastic litter in the water around city park that is used by animals as their habitat and by people for outdoor acitivities.
#nola #citypark #loopnola #achschipmunks

We plan on surveying the area around New Orlean's City Park> New Orleans has a diverse ecosystem with marshes and bayous.  In City Park, there are roads and there is an interstate nearby. There are many bike paths, football and soccer fields where people congregate.

We think it is important for people to realize the effect they have on the animals and plants in City Park.  Not only does plastic litter make the park less beautiful, it breaks down and smalls animals can eat it and get sick.

### What are we working on now:

We have made baby legs and assembled a balloon mapping kit.  We will go on the 13th to City Park and use canoes to get samples all around the water in City Park.  
We will trawl the baby legs in the water for 5 minutes at a time.  We will record the amount of material we collect.  We will also pick up large plastic pieces and record those.  We will use the balloon mapping kit to survey the area and use map knitting app to record the images.  
We will post the data and findings when complete.

Students surveyed the water outlined on the City Park map.  They also took water samples around the banks of the water.
