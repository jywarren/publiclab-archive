# GSoC FAQ

Please post your questions here!

###What are our main communication channels?

The default real-time communication channel is http://publiclab.org/chat

The plots-gsoc mailing list is for gsoc-related stuff, but plots-dev is for coding questions and technical topics: http://publiclab.org/lists

###How shall we do orientation meetings?

Once project teams are known, let's have each (student + mentors) meet individually if possible on IRC (the above chat room) or skype, just to say hello!

###What should I do to prepare for the summer?

Post your project and details to the [GSoC 2014 page](/wiki/gsoc-2014), following [last year's format](/wiki/gsoc-2013). Include your Github account and your own fork of the project you're working on.
