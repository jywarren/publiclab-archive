Umm... It's quite a while since I fired up my Raspberry Pi but as far as I recall it has a couple of activity LEDs plus two status LEDs on the network connector. You really don't want a load of LED's flashing inside the spectrometer housing. I think you will have to mount it to one outer side of the spectrometer.
