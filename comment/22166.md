 Hi Chris,
         I suppose 'dedicated IR camera' is not the best term. I simply have a DSCV1 and an F717, which are capable of 'normal colour photography, and infrared.
       "You can use an appropriate red filter on a full spectrum camera to capture mostly NIR in the blue channel and mostly red in the red channel." So, are you saying that any colour camera (not converted to IR) is good for NIR by placing the Rosco 19 filter in front of the lens?
