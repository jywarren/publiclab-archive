Hi Mustapha, we've reached out to one person who does low-cost solar and wind in the middle east, and another who is an aerospace engineer. Hope we hear back! In the meantime, what do you think of this kind of DIY project? https://www.instructables.com/id/BUILD-A-NOCTURNAL-SOLAR-LIGHT-BULB/ Is this kind of prototype you might want to try to build, if you could get the parts? Please advise!
