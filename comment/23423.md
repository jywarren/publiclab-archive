 Hi [@maggpi](/profile/maggpi)! Great to see you again! We are really interested in solving this in JavaScript, so I wonder if you would be able to explore whether this could be factored into a JavaScript module using OpenCV.js?

https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/237 covers some of the issues. And there is some discussion I know you're aware of in terms of the structure of the code and functions in [@rexagod](/profile/rexagod)'s proposal starting here: https://publiclab.org/notes/rexagod/03-11-2019/gsoc-proposal-mapknitter-orb-descriptor-w-auto-stitching-pattern-training-and-live-video-support-and-ldi-revamp-major-ui-enhancements#c22114

Thanks so much for your proposal!!!
