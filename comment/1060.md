Wanted to make sure folks also saw this <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/jacobsimonson/10-19-2011/wetable-and-charm">posting</a> by John Jacobs with the Texas Sea Grant and the Texas Coastal Watershed Program describing their experiences with the touchtable and the development of a scenario planning application focusing on coastal communities (CHARM).  I like the name they choose, weTable!
