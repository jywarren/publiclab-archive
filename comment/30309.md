I love this question and have wondered similar things myself.  From my position, professionally, I've seen organizations like Earthjustice and Center for International Environmental Law do great work. But your point is valid, there is an inherent power structure that cannot be diminished.  I'm curious if reaching out to talk to the folks working on local cases through those orgnizations could refer you to more horizonal, community-rooted clinics that more emulate the spaces you're looking for.  I know of other orgs like [Lawers for Good Government](https://www.lawyersforgoodgovernment.org/climate-change/#climatejustice) or volunteering through legal clinics (like this one in [Chicago](https://www.cvls.org/get-legal-help/legal-clinics/)) could get you closer to those types of spaces.
