that was a fun trip!

In high winds I've put a tail on my deltas to prevent overflight, especially when I'm reeling in string.  The bridle position could be readjusted but adding a tail is just much easier. 

tails can serve many purposes, I would just caution about trying to fix an asymmetrical or unstable delta with asymmetrical tails.
