Hi stoft, I am really impressed by your organised experiment design and statistics approach.Compared with your's my tests are kindergarten stuff...  ;-)

When I did the reproducibility test with the CFL lamp I noticed it was 2 hours capturing spectra and 4 hours or more processing the data. I worked right into the wee hours. I imagine you must have worked 24/7 for this note, huh? Great work!
