 This is really great, thanks [@sylvan](/profile/sylvan)!!! Lots to build on here. 

I think there may be two paths forward here - first, I'd love to see the draft list of issues and we can probably help refine/build out that list a bit even before it's ready to be turned into GitHub issues. 

Second, the STYLE GUIDE!!! This is going to be great and I'm eager to get started on it. Thanks!!!
