What's a good way to determine this? Would it work to [set up a test somewhere there is H2S](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/11-28-2017/how-to-select-a-site-for-hydrogen-sulfide-testing), alongside a [calibrated H2S detection technique](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/12-04-2017/what-are-different-commercially-available-hydrogen-sulfide-detection-methods) and compare readings?
