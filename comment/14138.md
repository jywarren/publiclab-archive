Hi Warren, thanx again for your input. Next time we get some sun I will try to work with reflective surfaces to reduce overall light intensity to avoid the overexposure. I guess the clipping of a single colour (for instance blue) will also affect the sum curve, won't it? I wasn't aware of that problem before I read your comment. Will be interesting to see, whether paper reflection changes the spectrum (i.e. absorbing colours...) Oh and thanx also for pointing me at the substraction of waves. Seems interesting. You know, I'm not a scientist and am just beginning to work with the spectrometer, but there seems to be a whole new world waiting to get discovered...
