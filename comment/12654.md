Please help. If it is possible to describe all the work with the plugin. How to create  "—Åomma-separated variable (CSV) file with the reflectance values for each of the reference targets in the image that you want to use to calculate the calibration coefficients." I am using mobius cam from http://infragram.org/. Thanks!
