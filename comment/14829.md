I think the original idea about what kind of thing to haul up into the sky was that it would be a like a sponge, allowing the air to pass through and offering LOTS of tasty surface area. Conversation drifted (pun intended) to the DIY idea of loosely spun sugar. Great time to reach out to a microbial biologist!
