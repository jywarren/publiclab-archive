Can you go outside? I'd say the classic kite + camera flight, followed by mapmaking is still a crowd-pleaser! To make it super short, you could already have a balloon inflated with a camera going that you could bring our group outside to do a selfie under, then haul the balloon down and look at the picture and georeference it in mapknitter
