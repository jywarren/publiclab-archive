This is a great idea to catch people at the bottom of a post they appreciated. I anticipate that this is a great pathway for the Blog, for instance. Subscribing to the Public Lab blog is a nice "slower lane" of involvement. 

For other types of content i am *less* excited to see subscription separated from the tagging area. I will mull on ideas to address this!
