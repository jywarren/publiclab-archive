Hi everyone , 

I would like to take input from the community to give suggestions on how we can improve the use of Leaflet-environmental-layers and Leaflet-blurred-location (which will be soon live on plots2) library . 

I would like to work on these inputs in the coming summer. 

Thank you ðŸ˜ƒ !
