I responded to Kloots' comment (above) by email, but by the time he got it he had already diagnosed and fixed the problem.  As I understand it, the problem arose from having the wrong microcontroller board assigned in Energia.  If you encounter this issue, please read the text in this research note under the heading "Stuff you don't necessarily need to do", starting below the second figure. 
Best,
