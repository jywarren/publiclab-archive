I don't recall seeing instructions for making spectra of plant leaves. Such a spectrum could be of the light reflected from the surface of a leaf or transmitted through the leaf. The nature of either spectrum would be a function of both the spectral reflectivity or transmittance of the leaf and also the spectral quality of the light source. By comparing the pure light source with the light after it had been reflected or transmitted by a leaf, you could learn something about the interactions of plant pigments with different wavelengths.
