Hi warren.  I just noticed your post.  Obviously I am just getting to learn how this stuff is organized, and am struggling a bit. 


Chrome displays a blank spectrum and says not supported. This is on a Nexus 10.

Opera - I cannot use the Capture Spectra dropdown selections, to get to the beta capture I had to navigate on the PC, and type the url manually.   I was able to display the spectrum on the screen, but not perform a capture or a calibration.
