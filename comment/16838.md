I have not tried [MAPS.ME](http://maps.me/en/home). It looks like it allows you to save base map data to your phone while you have a data connection, and then display the maps after the data connection is lost. I think this is a common feature of GPS apps. A less common feature of MAPS.ME is that it is open source.
