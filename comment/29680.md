Public Journal Entry 1
I  was walking from a snowball stand and saw a fast food soda cup that looked like it was used once and just got dirty in mud. It is not in a landfill or being recycled because the person that was in possession of it decided to throw it on the ground, littering the community, instead of putting in the trash can.
