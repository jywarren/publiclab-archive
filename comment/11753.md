It weighs so little that I just used duct tape to adhere a loop to the back. You probably don't want to cover the fake silver buttons as Mathew mentioned they're used as a heat dissipator. 

I've also used a roll of inside out tape and a rubber band to attach it to a piece of cardboard with a fin on it to stop it from rotating. The low weight makes impromptu riggings pretty easy.
