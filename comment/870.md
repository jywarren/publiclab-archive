It looks like you need a little rectangular glass container for the olive oil, like a tiny aquarium. Then the laser can shine right along the inside of the glass and all the oil along the glass will fluoresce.  Then use a slit aligned with the laser beam so only the fluorescing oil can be seen.  Align that slit with the spectrometer slit and only light from the fluorescence will enter the spectrometer.  A longer exposure sure would be helpful.
