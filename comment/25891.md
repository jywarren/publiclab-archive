Sorry for slow response here! Just checking -- so, exporting generates downloads, which then appear under "download."

And, the thing with exporting is that it overwrites the previous export. 

You can also hold the shift key and drag to select all the images you want, and a download button will appear on the map, upper left. This is a beta feature, but may work... it just takes a really long time!
