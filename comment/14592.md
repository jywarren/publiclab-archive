[@stevie](/profile/stevie) What I wanted to show is on clicking the Add Comment button the comment editor will show up below all comments of that section.

 For answers we can use an interactive editor similar to that used for posting notes as I have shown in the updated mockup. That way we can improve the user experience as well as distinguish it from the comments editor.
