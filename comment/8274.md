I would be happy to send any files you need to your email.  Just let me know how to find your email address. 
Alternatively, you should be able to get a pdf file of the schematic from https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/WheeStat5_0/blob/master/WheeStat5_1Board/WheeStat5_1_Schematic.pdf. There should be a button labelled "raw" that allows you to download the original pdf file.
