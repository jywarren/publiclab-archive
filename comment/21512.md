I really liked the designs. 

I want to implement this,
``Subscribe to this post's topics | Select topics + so they're hidden and all checked by default, but if you expand, you can uncheck some``.
I am working on similar stuff, [#4283](/n/4283). Let's finish the backend first this week. Then let's change the checkboxes into better UI.
