I was wondering if [@davidmanthos](/profile/davidmanthos) knows a bit about how to access this in an easier way - David, is there a way to get a TMS or even WMS of the Landsat thermal data? To colorize it we could pipe it through a version of Infragram which runs as a proxy service. Leaflet.infragram.js would be a great plugin!
