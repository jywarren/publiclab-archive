looking at the sensor sensitivity graph for the Nikon D200, its interesting that green is the least sensitive channel in the infrared band, implying that that channel might actually get the cleanest visible light channel if calibrated correctly.  [MaxMax is showing green to be the least IR-passing channel in at least the models they studied.](http://maxmax.com/spectral_response.htm)

I didn't do a big search here, but there are several green filters that pass infrared and block blue and red channels.
