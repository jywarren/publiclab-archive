At the Open Hour today, we brainstormed allowing users to flag a post with "the information in this post has been superceded by a newer research note" and submit a link to the newer note.

In this way historical info can be preserved, new users can find up to date procedures, and new users and other editors can help in the co-creation of organization :D
