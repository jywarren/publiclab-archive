The channels were excavated by the US Fish and Wildlife Service using an aquatic excavator in partnership with the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Ducks Unlimited, NOAA, and the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation. The channels were excavated to establish connectivity between the main stem of French Creek and tributaries or potential spawning areas. These meandering channels are believed to enhance fish passage.
