Hi Jeff, I had submitted a pull request to publiclab mapknitter repo yesterday. Should I send a pull request to your repo as well?

The features work individually with visible bugs while dragging and zooming. I think we can still try them out. I have some idea about how to solve them and integrate the features. I changed the leaflet source on my local machine with some success. I think I can work on it as we collect feedback or if somebody has a better solution then we can discuss and solve it?
