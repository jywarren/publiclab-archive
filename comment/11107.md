I myself am really curious about this issue in general, especially as I dive more into developing open environmental monitoring hardware :) 

Maybe we could put together a little 'brief' regarding our questions (maybe this research note + comment thread is already enough), and follow Sara's suggestion about presenting this to someone at the Berkman Center?  They seem to have folks who would dig this topic / issue ...
