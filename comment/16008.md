I finally got round to making the Raman spectrometer. I first tried at right angles and as you found I got nothing. So I went for the transmission and here is a very poor spectrum I got of water (bend at about 130 pixels and stretches at 90 pixels) the peaks at around 200 are breakthrough from the laser. I seem to be getting quite a lot of light from the laser that is not at its laser frequency and I only have a long pass filter. So the logical thing to try is the back-scattering cofiguration which should reduce this.
Once again thanks for the help until I saw your paper I had not thought it was possible with such a simple setup.

Note water probably works well in this case as I have got poor resolution as I'm using a 256 element linear array (I need to up this).
