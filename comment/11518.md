If you are looking for an extremely stable FPV drone, may I suggest that you check out the FPV49 3v which has a KFm4 airfoil. Trond of Norway has posted several videos that show how easy it is to build this aircraft. He also has many videos which demonstrate the inherent stability of this design. http://youtu.be/dh4GjMbsCk8
