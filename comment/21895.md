 Hey [@warren](/profile/warren)! I have an idea. Right now it seems there are much more students than mentors. I have a decent knowledge of JavaScript, I have created some FTO-issues across PL's projects and I'm getting quite familiar with them, so may I put my name on the list of potential mentors (https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-ideas)? I'm planning on submitting a proposal as a student just like before, and decide if I'll participate as student or mentor later. What do you think? Thanks!

Update: I am not able to add my name on the list of potential mentors. Is this a bug or only admins can add names? Thanks!

Update 2: Here are my contributions, as required:
