Hi Tom, Chris,

(Tom, I'm Charlie, the UMass Amherst faculty who was out in the canoe with Chris. Thanks for doing this work!)
 
Chris - just to be clear, the image that Tom was working with was one that had "stitched together" from several photos taken over the morning, right?  If so, my hunch too is that the less blue patch might be because of change in the illumination differences across images.

Is there one, single high altitude image that has both patches in it?

It would be interesting to hear what Ned Horning thinks about this.

-- cheers, Charlie Schweik
