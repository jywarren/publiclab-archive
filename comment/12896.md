Hi [@claf](/profile/claf) 

I'm wondering if you have any updates on this work? I'm glad that you are incorporating audio and video into the box. Video could be useful for things like truck counts, and audio for the roaring of flaring coming from wells and compressor stations. Does this prototype that you've put together have any air quality sensors? I've been working with a group that's using PM2.5 monitors (Specks):  http://publiclab.org/notes/chrisbartley/04-15-2014/speck-particle-monitor
