Chris, thanks for pulling this together. For me, video takes so long to gather up and post. In this case, the result was well worth it. 

So many neat things are highlighted. I really like the color coding of temperature on the gps flight track in 3D.

Did the hydrogen generation effort finally inflate a bag? If not, what should be done differently to make this a viable alternative, given the current helium shortage?

See you in New Orleans.
