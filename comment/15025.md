Hi, [@dhaffnersr](/profile/dhaffnersr), are you saying htere are absorption peaks in the visible range (400-750nm) for 2-stroke oil and/or gasoline? I wasn't aware of that. I'm not convinced that the two will fluoresce the same; our [#oil-testing-kit](/tag/oil-testing-kit) work (https://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit) was based on the red-shift in the fluorescence spectrum of heavier petroleum products.
