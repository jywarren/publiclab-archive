 The simplest modification to make the sketch save to SD card once per minute is to change the line:

    if (logData == 1)                       // write to SD card every x cycles

to 

     if (logData == 20)                       // write to SD card every x cycles

With that change, the LCD will be updated every 3 seconds but data will be saved once every minute.
