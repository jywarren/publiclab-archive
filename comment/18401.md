We have finally published:

A Flexible Arduino-Based Logging Platform for Long-Term Monitoring in Harsh Environments
[http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/2/530](http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/2/530)

Sensors is an open access journal, so the PDF is free to download. By the standards of most DIY instrument papers, we probably over-shot the mark by a fair margin. The irony there is that even with many years of underwater work, we still wish we had more data.
