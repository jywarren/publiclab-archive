In the comment section of the post linked below there is a link to a large cohort of images, thou I'm not sure if they represent airborne dust particles. Having looked at the posts from the last couple of years by many Public lab collaborators I feel that this issue has been dealt with rather well, so I'm not sure if the small code snippet I wrote is that relevant. 
That being said - I will be happy to upload it somewhere, is there a section of the git where it should go?
