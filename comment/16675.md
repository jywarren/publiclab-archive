Oh well. I know about everyones strange reluctance to use microchip devices, but really they do not keep much of any value to the experimenter hidden. If you look at their datasheets the PIC16F18326 is 470 pages long in fact it is probably too detailed.
If anyone is interested I use the open source Great Cow Basic (which is excellent) to program the chips. I have a homemade programmer to load and read into and out of flash memory.
The data from the flash memory(in HEX) is processed into a graph using (open source) QB64.
