gotcha.  Okay.  You're referring to the [VidView JDEPC-OV04](http://www.szsjd.com/en/detail-66.html)?  That's the model number on the datasheet next to "Datasheet for Infragram Webcam" at the [bottom of the infragram page](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram#Datasheets).   Has it changed or is that still the one?
