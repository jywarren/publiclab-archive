I'd be *completely* satisfied with 'troubled visionary'.

On a more serious note: these students are super clever, interested in radio controlled cars and quad copters, and excited about coming up with some (implementable) approach to implementing the 'sky crane' collecting-samples-from-some-hard-to-reach location.  Stay tuned for prototypes ...
