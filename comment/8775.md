Mathew -- I have never been so eager to follow a missing link -- where's the wall-climbing remote control toy car?! :)  

Wait a minute -- are you suggesting -- automatic thermal imaging done by a **Roomba for vertical surfaces**?  ZOMGosh!  

If we have trouble sending our Vertical Roomba up a glass window, we could try the techniques they used for the [snail robot](http://video.mit.edu/watch/robosnail-2845/)  (Warning: video may contain depictions of artificial mucus.)

It would be pretty sweet to set up motors and strings on the x- and y-axis above a wall, and, keeping track of the sensor's position, develop a picture of the wall's thermal profile over time.  A wall scanner.  

Also -- I think there are versions of this IR sensor part we're using that have different ranges / sensing profiles ... from what I remember, they use varying heights of the 'can' on top of the sensor in order to narrow the 'field of view' -- could we set up a sensor on an x/y servo platform and scan a wall?
