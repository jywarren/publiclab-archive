The simplest way to coordinate the testing would be to use the spectral workbench already in place on PLOTS.  When you create a filter, run it through a calibrated spectrometer and tag the spectrum [#irfilter](/tag/irfilter) or something like that, and put in the description:  Exact type of film used, type of light exposed to, time exposed to light, development process, light source used for spectral reading.  Also, if we're going to compare results from each other, we'd have to decide on a standardized light source to shine through the filter into the spectrometer, such as a certain specific light bulb widely available, and decide on a place to have the film developed, like a specific chain store that uses a consistent development process in all locations.
