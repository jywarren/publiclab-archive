Perhaps that's easy for me to say, since i work not for the university, but for a membership based organization where the dues paying members influence the direction of projects.  I can see where there's often tension between a large, land-owning institution that may have been a community bully in the past, and residents, who are often very interested in the local data, and having someone talk to them about what they are seeing, if we can get past the class politics.
