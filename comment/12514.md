This looks like a surefire way to waterproof the wires. But now you have to waterproof the seal between the stopper and the bottle. Plastic water bottles are not designed to work with stoppers and typically there will be only one narrow (circular) point of contact between them. Knocking the stopper could dislodge it. A stopper could work well if there was something to hold it in tightly. With a submerged collapsible plastic water bottle, water pressure will exert pressure to expel the stopper (I think, and with a rigid bottle, water pressure would hold the stopper in?). 

Is there a way to leverage the threads on the water bottle cap? These seem to seal tightly in normal use, and the gasket could be enhanced. But then it's still hard to waterproof the wires. I'm still not convinced that there are any sound arguments to use a plastic water bottle for this purpose. There must be many better solutions.
