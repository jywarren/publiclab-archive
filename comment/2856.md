mnc: I haven't had a chance to fix the spectrometer yet, but I think I know what's wrong: the CD fragment I received was slightly discolored in places. I tried to cut out a normal area, but I may have used a discolored one, as I couldn't tell which was the correct coloration.

I'm going to grab a blank CD of my own and cut out a piece of that.
