Thank you for sharing updates on this project! Is the team planning to highlight specific times when you received community reports of odors or plumes on the timeseries graphs? It could be useful to see if the reports coincided with high readings.

One other suggestion is to consider displaying the "Amount of Time over 12 Î¼g/m3" as a percentage of the monitoring period.
