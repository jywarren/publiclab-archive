Ohhh thats why... i will give a try to the infinity focus... thats under "subject distance: option ?
The nex3 and the nex5 have the same sensor I think, I will need to double check... its a death camera, It's almose impossible to get spare parts here in Argentina (legal issues with customs) so i will give it a try for this project. So i need a Red filter, thats why the NDVI from my A2300 did't work... i have the Rosco 2007 now
