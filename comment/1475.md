Hello all,
I have been playing around with a cellphone spectrometer design in sketchup.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/x51yl.png" width="360" height="200"/>
The rest of the album is available <a href="http://imgur.com/a/wG0P9">here</a>.
The design should work with iPhone as well as android phones. I know Warren's sketch and other designs show it open toward the top but it will make the base extend beyond the top on iPhone cameras. This will work with different degree diffraction gratings.
