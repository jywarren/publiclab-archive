For the most part I am not able to reliably and accurately validate NDVI calculations. To validate results you would need to have targets with known reflectance values that are not used as part of the calibration. You can use published reflectance curves to estimate NDVI from certain features and that will let you know if your results are roughly accurate. Using a spectrometer would provide more accurate reference data.
