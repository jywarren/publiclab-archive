Chris,
Very nice work! It looks like you have the process down well. 
Thanks for including the additional requirements to your post. I should update my notes to reflect the C++ and DirectX library requirements as well. 
Also, it looks like you used the correct PLY output from CMPMVS in MeshLab. 
I believe it's called meshAvImgCol.ply
