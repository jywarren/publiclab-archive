Hi, this is an interesting project.  I'm curious, do you think it's really necessary to convert the aquarium pump from blower to suction?  If you blew the air into the roots, it would still have to exhaust somewhere.  I don't have the testing equipment you do but would be curious to see results comparing suction vs blower.
