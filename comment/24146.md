 Obviously kind of an old article, but I am just getting into arduino and electronics in general.  My question is I have a similar project to this and I like the idea of using a resistor to bypass the trim pot but I don't know the original resistance of the existing trimpot on this / understand Ohms law etc.  Is it ridiculous to try extending out the delay on the timer to be more like 8 hours using a different resistor?
