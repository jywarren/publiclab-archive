Thanks [@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker)! Question for you - The sample bottles I found here are a little smaller than ones I've used in the past, and the ones suggested in the WI Grab Sample procedure document (500ml vs 1qt). What type/size bottles do you use, and do you know where people can get them?
