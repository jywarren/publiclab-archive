let's all go out and keep this concrete lilypad afloat!

in regards to keeping these clean, residents are liable for sweeping in FRONT of the catch basin.  perhaps these steps can be avoided if a finer grate is placed in front of the basin;

a grate that can be removed before a deluge...but would make the residents' duty of cleaning in front of the basin (not the basin itself, which is DPW / Dept of Public Works) 

make that residents' duty much more effective, since the existing 8" holes let in everything. 

This is similar to the SmartVents for under your house, the ones that float open during a flood event. 

This idea brought to you by this one guy i talked to at the Blue House fika from a month ago
