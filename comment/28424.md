Hi, which browser are you using on your cell phone to run spectral workbench? In [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) or [Opera](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.browser) or Chrome on an Android Phone it allows you  to select which camera you are using. Unfortunately live capture isn't available at this time on iOS, but you can capture your  spectra with your phone's native camera and upload to the website using the [upload interface](https://spectralworkbench.org/upload).
