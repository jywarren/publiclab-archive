[@warren](/profile/warren), I was wondering if it would it be possible to use a variation of this technique to combine a series of images taken over the course of a growing season for the purpose of highlighting differences in the rate of photosynthesis that occurred in an agricultural field? If so, do you think that would be complicated or would it just involve adding more images and tweaking in some way what you show in the video? Thanks!
