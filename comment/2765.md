Did you do the infrared conversion? 

In any case, I bet your camera is out of focus. You do need to focus it closer, whether or not you do the conversion -- it needs to be focused on the slit itself. A good way to focus it is to point it at a barcode about 4-5" away and turn the lens. Heating it with a hair dryer can loosen up the threads.
