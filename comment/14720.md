Wow, so that might be a bug in the post writing front end. I used a standard markdown formatting for code input, which worked in preview, but broke spectacularly in actual post layout. 

I just put the code on Github, feel free to fork, clone, and change. https://github.com/kinasmith/publicLab/tree/master/Riffle
