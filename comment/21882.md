Just noting some similarities between this design and GitHub's new dashboard design:

Quick links to your projects and pages on left, "Discover" to the right, and an activity column down the middle. Interesting distinction between "Recent" and "All" activity, which I'm inclined to ignore, but the rest, yeah - classic dense but relatively uncluttered GitHub layout.
