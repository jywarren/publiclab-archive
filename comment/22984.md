[@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) - yes, I saw the other discussion, but it had seemed to go on a tangent. ‘crazy’ [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) I think hits it right on the head (gotta love that autocorrect). Ive ordered one, will follow-up with them on special operating characteristics, and follow-up here with my results. Probably a couple of weeks given my travel, etc.
