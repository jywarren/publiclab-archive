It "looks" just like the one at the top of this page within the blue legos.

That is why I figured it is the same one that you would get with the basic webcam kit and someone would have info on it. I paid $3 for it shipped from eBay, but the same camera is listed everywhere as the cheapest thing you can get. I have no specs on it.
