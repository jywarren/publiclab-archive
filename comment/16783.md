I am trying to figure out the same question. So far, I have decided that the most accessible method seems to be using mapping technology to correlate data to GPS locations, then look for hot spots/concentrated areas. The downside is that a wider net would have to be cast to find source areas, or multiple source areas. Also, contacting local regulatory agencies who may already have data that will aid in site selection, potential source areas, etc. is sure to turn up something useful.
