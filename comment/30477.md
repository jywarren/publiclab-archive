A biome is a specific ecosystems whereby all the organisms' function -abiotic and biotic-, live, and thrive in a special set environment. It is important to the study of environmental science because it allows us to get to know the habitat of all organisms and how they work. It gives the people that study environmental science more information about how organisms contribute to the environment. Organisms provide resources to humans like chicken.
