That's why I'm thinking [collecting dust on tape, scanning it, and using an algorithm to calculate particle size and maybe type](http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/04-22-2014/frac-sand-mining) would be a good idea.  Not exactly real time, but as you said, people don't need to be told when its dusty-- they need to prove it was to the right people.
