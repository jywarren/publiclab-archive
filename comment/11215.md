I had some ideas (talking with [@rjstatic](/profile/rjstatic)) about how a more Bower- or NPM-style utility could parse such files... these are just roughly sketched out ideas -- say we called it "newt":

* `newt init` -- questoinnaire
* `newt register` <my-package-name> <git-endpoint> -- tests for presence of req'd docs, clones repos or zips
* `newt compile bom` -- aggregate/merge BOMs of nested projects
* `newt compile bom <string>` -- aggregate/merge BOMs with links matching provided `string` like "digikey.com"
* `newt compile price <int>` -- calculate unit price for `int` units
* `newt compile contributors` -- compile contributors of nested projects
