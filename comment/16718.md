Hi -- well, there may be methods like that; just to put in another idea, although you probably won't want to do it; Dorn Cox from Farm Hack has actually mowed, dried, and weighed biomass from different test plots to validate. There is some on this under the [#ifarm](/tag/ifarm) tag, from a few years ago.
