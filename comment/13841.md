One way to test [@stoft](/profile/stoft)'s idea that this may just be within the repeatability limits of the hardware, rather than a difference in materials, would be to scan a glass cuvette a few times (removing it each time, say, so small differences in its placement happen) and see if the differences vary more or less than the comparison here. The same might be done with repeated scans of a quartz cuvette. It'd be a good plot to examine!
