There's a macro for interval capture, though it hasn't been used in a while. 

https://gist.github.com/jywarren/4945996

You can paste it into the "macros" pane accessible by a button in the left column if the capture interface. It has a "seconds" parameter you can tweak. Hope that helps and happy to help you configure it!
