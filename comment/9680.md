this is awesome.  unfortunately a lot of sites i deal with are oil exploration and production waste sites, so are exempt from these USA laws and EPA procedures. but i'm excited to learn.  we've got some leaky landfills too, that i way start to monitor via southwings (our lighthawk crew down gulf coast way)
