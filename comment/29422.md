Thanks [@ekpeterman](/profile/ekpeterman)!   

[@pat](/profile/pat)  and [@dswenson](/profile/dswenson)- I know reclamation is something you all have been on a lot recently, do you have any thoughts on accountability with inactive permits? 

[@eustatic](/profile/eustatic)  - what do you do about drilling permits that lapse? and violations - thinking of Taylor spill or otherwise?
