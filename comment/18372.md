Hi there, 
my apologies, but I have not been here for a while. If you like, any of my projects published on instructables could be reposted as activity here. I even had been improving the whole thing a bit, but habe been to busy since to prepare a reasonable documentation and work on this concept a bit more. My intention had been to build a larger version that would allow to screen 96 well plates. I even had build a prototype, but then changed the job and the focus.
