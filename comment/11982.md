An additional site http://www.discriminator.nl/ais/index-en.html and http://www.discriminator.nl/index-en.html show how to do it with any radio that will receive the correct frequency.  

http://opencpn.org/ocpn/ is good also.

You probably want a cardioid pattern for your antenna since there is likely close to 180 degrees you want to receive from. The Moxon antenna (http://www.moxonantennaproject.com/design.htm) would be good.
