[@warren](/profile/warren), i am referring to some barriers for connecting to iphones. conceptual barriers that can be circumvented exactly by this method. we use the browser, so no app has to be installed. the rest goes via the basic input plug and no one can ban me from plugin a microphone and making some chrips... also nice is, that the FSK is a method of transmitting data that is about 100 years old :-)
