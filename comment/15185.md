I would like to add, that in addition to evidence, the protocols for processing that data are as important as in the collection of that evidence, quality assurance practices and careful lab procedures should  always be followed in order to minimize possible errors, and most importantly, is to journey in the direction that the evidence leads you to , not the other way around.
