Hi Amir,

I gone through your ppt about hyperspectral imaging and it is really very simple and easy to understand. I am into recycling of plastic, i think we can use your concept of hyperspectral imaging for identification and sorting of various plastic at low cost. can you help me developing this product. you can mail me on shaikhgous@gmail.com

thank you
