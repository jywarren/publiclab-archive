I am a phiyicist and part of coletivo tecnotrecos.that cares about education, open knowledge and art. We dont have a stable place , but we are always around rio, sao paulo e minas. We are in the beggining of our researchs, but really engaged about sharing what we have been learning., we are all ready to help with the list, if you could tell us how to, Liz.
