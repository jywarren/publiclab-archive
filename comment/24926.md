Yes, and the aromatic baby powder is nice because you can smell it. Great idea. We're going to try prototyping this activity soon. With 3+ sensors, would this be an interactive activity that would help in talking with community members about sensor placement?

Actually, the NASA team ( [#aren](/tag/aren)) we're working with is interested in this, and they do classroom and informal science education. We may be able to work with them a bit on this at the GLOBE meeting in Detroit in a few weeks.
