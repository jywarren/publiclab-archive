OK, i got inspired and wrote a basic macro "sandbox console". You can now write simple macros as described at:

http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-api

One that works right now is:

    setup: function() { window.open($W.canvas.toDataURL(),'_newtab').focus()}

which saves an image of the current spectral data waterfall.
