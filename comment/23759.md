[@warren](/profile/warren),  Yes, I too think that our primary focus should be to refine and to optimize the standalone libs like spectral-workbench.js and then integrate them back into the main project as this is the main reason why we have refactored it from the main codebase.

Also, regarding the testing part, for webcam access we can use tests on the .getUserMedia() function . For the part of whether we should share components with the spectral-workbench.js or not, I think we can include that library as its dependency and use it in this as a package, can we ?

Please correct me wherever I am wrong. Thanks ðŸ™‚
