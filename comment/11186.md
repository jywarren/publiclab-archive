That's a great photo. Newtown Creek looks inviting. The smog looks just the way smog is supposed to look. The brown tint is from NO and NO2 which is made when cars or furnaces (or anything) burn fuel. Most of the N comes from the air, but fuels which contain lots of nitrogen can produce more NOx. I don't know which fuels have more N.
