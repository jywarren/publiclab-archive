Very interesting video.  I don't know what the instruments cost is now.  In the late 90s, a microscope FTIR, with ATR and libraries for analysis of microparticles, ran around $100k.  That was used for the pharm/Medical industry, but we analyzed very similar microparticles. No experience with Raman.  We did similar bio testing(cyto) for approval of new devices.  Previous bio tests were "rat and rabbit"(acute systemic and intracutaneous toxicity). Those aren't used as much, now.
