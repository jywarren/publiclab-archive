Ok, just took a look, replied no, still broken. I cleared cache with no effect. I filed another bug report as I cannot even use the switch to a 'new calibration' -- which just brings up the error page (The page you were looking for doesn't exist). Individual bugs like this are a pain if they are not easy to reproduce.
