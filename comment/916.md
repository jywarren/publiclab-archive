Something mobile is definitely a great idea. Funnily enough i was just looking at the rPi site before checking in here!  A mobile spectrometer solution is something that i have been thinking about for a while now.

One way to have an interface could be to use a wireless dongle and run a web server.

Of course the hard part of it all is getting your hands on a Ras Pi at the moment...
