Hi, this is a good question, but I wanted to suggest possibly adapting the WebGL implementation which is awfully fast: 

https://github.com/p-v-o-s/infragram-js/blob/master/public/infragram-gl.coffee

In either case, I'm very interested in reworking infragram's core libs and adding a test suite -- whether implemented in JS, GL, or C, we should be able to pass in an image and a transformation expression, and get the same output -- that way peoples' infragram expressions would be portable between different implementations, and developing a new implementation would be easier since it'd have to pass the same test suite. 

I didn't write the GL implementation, but have worked on the JS one a lot, and it needs a lot of structural/modularity work. Happy to offer more input as you decide which way to go, and perhaps we could select a set of before/after images to use as our common test suite. Thanks!
