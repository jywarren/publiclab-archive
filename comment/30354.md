Interesting.  We would do some of the individual tests, for example oil and grease.  These were only done for a short period of time ( a year or two to get baseline), and then occasionally afterwards.  Another example was zinc ( by AA).  That was done for quite a while and then occasionally.  Most of the other tests were sent out.  Thank you for the info!
