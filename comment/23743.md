 I've experienced this before, and generally it's resolved when I went through and double checked and repositioned the wires-- it could be that something somewhere isn't pushed down as far as it needs to be (there are metal strips under the holes, and it's possible if the wire is a little bent or not quite pressed in it miss making the connection).
