Yes, OpenStreetMap is an open project to crowdsource a map (they have a lot of institutional partners too, like my fair city, Portland, OR).  Mapillary is another layer to crowdsource streetview.  It doesn't have to be on a street, however, and could be used to place images around a facility. 

They have a few tutorials on using imagery that wasn't captured by their phone app too:
