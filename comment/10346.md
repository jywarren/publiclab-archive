changing the capacitance is really easy to explain to people.  every transition from a peak to trough of the wave form is queued in by the filling of the capacitor. So getting a longer or shorter wavelength depends on adjusting the "depth" to which the capacitor gets filled.  Its like adjusting the height of a toilet float in the flush tank so it fills faster/ flushes less.
