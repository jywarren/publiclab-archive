It looks like SoftModem-for-attiny85 doesn't include this line: https://github.com/rmeister/SoftModem/blob/webjack/SoftModem.cpp#L273-L304

    //  Brief carrier tone before each transmission
    ...
    size_t SoftModem::write(const uint8_t *buffer, size_t size)

I'd tackle this, but I think perhaps you know more about this than I... though I could give it a try.

It doesn't really seem like the conversion was too onerous, however. It seems like SoftModem could be modified with a constructor parameter to be usable with either ATMega or ATTiny architectures. What do you think? https://github.com/l1q1d/SoftModem-for-attiny85/commit/b6f08ca9ade1263b788dcde94fb0f4aefa65431c
