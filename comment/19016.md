Okay Vidit maybe [@warren](/profile/warren) has an opinion too. I have read the ActiveJobs documentation for rails and understand there are options for queue backend. From the [list](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html), I think Redis has the most support.

For deployment strategy, we don't use `capistrano` but we use `docker-compose`. Currently in production this is how we run MariaDB and expect to run the rails application soon too. There is a `Redis` [image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) you can use.
