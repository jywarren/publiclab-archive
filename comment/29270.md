Of you go to a commercial lab...quite expensive.  There is one commercial instrument maker that is very good at donating ( or at least dramatically reducing cost ) of instruments to educational facilities.  If you can combine low cost instruments with doing testing for info only, you have a chance.  Unfortunately, it didn't work. C'est la guerre.
