[@warren](/profile/warren) Thanks for your comments.
Prior to the IR filter removal, I had no indication that there was a  light transmission through the cover problem!. One can easily check as I did by wrapping the spectrometer in aluminum foil and observing any changes to the noise floor of the scan. My recent results on SW can be seen with the Cam1 NIR titles and sun sky tags.
At the time I did not think to take scans of the high ambient noise levels of the scans in bright conditions. results will likely vary due to the materials used in the covers.
