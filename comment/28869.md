Linking to this great 2010 Clean Air Act Academic Research Policy Manifesto: http://www.cacwny.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AcademicResearchPolicyFinalJune2010.pdf
>The Coalition controls the information collected through community studies conducted on the Coalition’s behalf. The Board must approve the study before it is conducted, as well as resulting presentations and publications before they are submitted outside of the Coalition. Academics wishing to use data collected through Coalition studies must submit a proposal to the Coalition’s Board of Directors who will vote to approve or deny access to the data.
