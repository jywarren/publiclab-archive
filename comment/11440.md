Good questions Bryan. [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro), I'd put those black boxes along the top of my sketch to provide color balance help, but Bryan's right; the tube itself could be enough in theory. Do you know what's needed? But they could still help to align the image, or even include a QR code.
