And what is web Push Server? And how Action Cable will be used along with it. I am just curious is this any other way to solve this problem? I guess you mixed the push notification and the use of action cable for notification because as far as I know you can't make push notification using Action Cable and for push notification, we need push server as you explained in the above diagram.
And also since action cable makes a socket connection when the website is loaded but the push notification works even when the website is opened. What do you think?
