Hi [@IgorWilbert](/profile/IgorWilbert), I like your idea for the development of Android application. [@warren](/profile/warren) [@liz](/profile/liz) we can be certain about the number of users using our website from mobile devices using Google Analytics if we want to get excited about this project. And, for sure Android app would be super useful to the moderators, without any doubt. 

Thanks!
