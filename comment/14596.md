Thanks for the feedback, love the Upvote :) 

Know we might not get feedback from [@liz](/profile/liz) for a while because she is traveling, but I'm interested to hear her thoughts on the badging system. In some ways it seems similar to something we've spoken of where someone's profile changes based on their amount of activity on PL which seems similar, but I'm weary of the authority it might give someone visibly on the site.
