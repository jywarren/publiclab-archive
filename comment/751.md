Wow!!! I don't know -- i see what you mean about the pinkness (what film/filter did you use?) but i think they look pretty good! Do you think there are exposure issues? I think the altitude looks great, though -- what is your concern?

Don't worry, we'll get the TMS thing working. I can try adding a feature to the tms-filter tool soon, and then we have to figure out the zoom-level issues.
