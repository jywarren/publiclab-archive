I love that you've posted this before it's "done"! I think we need to think of more ways to encourage people to do this in order to solicit input, get ideas out there, etc. 

I had even proposed to [@liz](/profile/liz) that we mark /all/ new posts as publicly visible`drafts` until (as a second step) you "publish" or "mark as complete" -- anyhow great to see, thanks!
