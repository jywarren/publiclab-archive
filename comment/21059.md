Hi, all! Just added one more item, which I'd like to see incorporated; it should be relatively easy to add in:

* script to go back through posts and tag first-timer posts with `first-time-poster` tag, retroactively so they show up at https://publiclab.org/tag/first-time-poster, to improve stats on first-time posting

Does this make sense? Thank you! [@radhikadua](/profile/radhikadua) 	[@quinn-codes-synthesis](/profile/quinn-codes-synthesis)  [@cess](/profile/cess)
