[@warren](/profile/warren) sounds good! There are enough people working with OAuth already, I think we can have it complete before summer too since it is a priority feature. I'll be working on calendar integration and Milestone 13 then. I've added it to the description and removed OAuth.
I'll start breaking up the issues of Milestone 13 and add it to the timeline! Any other suggestions?
