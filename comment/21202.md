It's worth testing but those cards you link to look promising. From my experience it's the bright target that is more of a problem than the dark targets. I expect there is significant clipping going on with the brightest pixels so when the image values are pegged at 255 they likely should be values significantly higher. That will in turn produce a linear regression with the "wrong" slope.
