I am going to attempt a Raman spectrometer. As I am in the design stages I was wondering why you chose "transmission" I am tempted to monitor at right angles so as to only get the scattered light.
I've also seen one that monitor back scatter, but then you need mirrors.
I would like to know your views on the geometry.
