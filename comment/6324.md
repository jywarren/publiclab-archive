It's good to hear I used the correct ply file. Another thing I could not figure out is whether there is a better way to animate the model while recording a video. Dragging it around in MeshLab results in jerky moves, as in my video, instead of nice smooth motion. There must be way to get a smooth animation of the model. 

And an important addition will be a way to embed the model so that anyone can interact with it directly. Can MeshLab models be embedded?
