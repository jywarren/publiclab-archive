The process that polyvinyl chloride ( PVC) degrades by is hehydrohalogenation.  First, one double bond is formed, then a second conjugated with the first, then a third conjugated with the first two, etc.  The process continues.  This is why clear PVC degrades by yellowing ( or blackening).  As more double bonds are added to the line, where the spectrum absorbs shifts from the infrared, to the near infrared, to the visible.  That's the basis of the question.  Thank you for any help.
