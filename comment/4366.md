I just successfully launched the little bear kite friday morning, in the middle of the city in a schoolyard 30m wide.  nothing but trees, powerlines, and busy streets everywhere. 

We had asked to access the roof, which would have guaranteed success, but were denied. 

I worked with Dan to do a pull start on the kite, to get above the wind shadow of the 40ft building. once i was out of the turbulence, the kite flew to about 300 ft.

I couldn't manuver on the ground very much, so i didn't hit the target for our photography, but I did get good photos of he yard and the neighborhood beyond. 

I'm more confident that i can launch a kite in almost any conditions, as long as there's wind.
