Hi, all - getting back into this real quick -- if folks have input, it's really useful to think about offering feedback under three headings:

1. **Issues** or problems you've identified with the current system/design
2. **Goals** you'd like this interface to achieve - big or small
3. **Ideas** you have for how to address the issues or goals you've identified

This helps us separate out what your "pain points" are from specific design proposals to consider. Thanks!
