[@stevie](/profile/stevie) Ok then we can drop the dislike button and keep a Upvote button similar to this one.
[![upvote.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/118/large/upvote.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/118/original/upvote.jpg)

Regarding the user approving an answer I think the person who posted the question should be the one who approves and it should not affect the overall response to that question because approval just adds a approval label to that question.Other answers are still present and the upvotes reflect its popularity. So an answer that seems more apt to others will have more no. of upvotes. While the user who posted the question can approve the answer that he was looking for that will add a approval label.Also it helps in the badging system.Please correct me if I am wrong.
