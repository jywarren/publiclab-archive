 > I have a day each week to review Pull Request (PR) and make some FTO issues so as to involve new contributors to my project. At the end of each milestone, I plan to test the implementation.

ðŸŽ‰ this is really nice. Thank you!

> June 12 -13: Testing these at different screen widths and on different devices.

A great idea! 

Also, we have a subscription to this service: http://lookback.io which may help to identify further UI issues and bugs if we can do some outreach and test each page with a reasonable number of testers -- say 7-10. Perhaps this could be part of the plan too!

Thank you so much for your proposal, and to everyone who left useful comments!
