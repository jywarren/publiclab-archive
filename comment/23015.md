Hi Chris, I believe this software was just soft-launched: https://fluxguard.com/ it is supposed to monitor sites and notify you of changes. you can do 75 pages for free. I think its mostly for quality assurance of your own websites but from what I could could tell you don't need to own the page to monitor it for changes. I could be wrong though!
