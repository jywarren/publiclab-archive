Hey Jeff, The card mock up is 5x8. The alcohol thermo and humidity meter is  9x 2.5 at its thickest point. I have 2 inch diameter coil spring humidity and thermomoters and one 2x4 inch digital meter with danglely probes.  I wonder if we will be able to get actual 1 degree accuracy with the alchohol or coil spring. so maybe the thermochromic won't be reducing our accuracy. the other way we could go is to more expensive, accurate digital. The photo uploader isn't working for me now but will upload a photo as soon as i can get it working.
