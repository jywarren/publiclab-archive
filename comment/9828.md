How to address Chris's concerns on imagery adding/editing/sharing seems like a tough nut to crack.  

Is there any way to overlay different mapknitter photo sets?  each map would then be its own thing, but there'd be a "supermap" of the different photo sets for the same site that could be loaded up.  This would solve the imagery issue, at the risk of creating a giant annotations headache-- what happens when someone annotates two overlayed maps?
