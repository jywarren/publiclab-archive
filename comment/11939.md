Wow, very cool. I'm thinking of what kinds of vessels could be easily adapted to a DIY version of the sort of spring-loaded bubble making frame in the Mini Buck. Maybe like two nested cylinders , with a spring between... hang on, i'll doodle it. 

OK, what about a pair of electric wires at the top which are connected by the bubble membrane before it's popped? And a rubber band based harness for dipping?
