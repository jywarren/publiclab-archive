[@Rgaude](/profile/Rgaude) great local observation where you live! I also have a lot of potholes near where I live in Tacoma, Washington. Our local newspaper the Tacoma Weekly used to do this fun community-led feature about pothole woes on our streets, which you can view here for some inspiration: https://www.seattleweekly.com/news/when-it-comes-to-dramatizing-the-plight-of-tacomas-pothole-plagued-residents-pothole/

It could be an activity to stir up some local attention with your local media outlets! Photos are strong sources for community science evidence. 

I will see if I can dig up more for you on your original question...
