Here is what the thermo and humidity meter look like next to the card. We could still use an alcohol thermo, this one is just a bit clunky. Also I worry about the metal coil humidity gauge. The pecto reptile one i bought stopped working after a few days and I think they are vulnerable to jostling damage.
