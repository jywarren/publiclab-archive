Thanks for the cheering [@liz](/profile/liz)!!
That reminded me - here's one other idea that may be useful. 
Holding the very long carp pole can be tiring, and pretty difficult to keep it at a relatively consistent height and angle. To improve on this I found a surplus canteen holder that we had, and my old belt and made a waist rig similar to what people use to carry flags in parades. It makes pole mapping a lot easier!

here is the set up, subbing a walking stick for my carp pole that I had just packed away, but you can get the idea.
