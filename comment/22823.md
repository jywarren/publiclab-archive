No problem -- i guess, so for example, I'm not sure if red ink shows up on black paper, but we use colored ink (red, blue) on brown paper when we make the ones in the store: https://store.publiclab.org/collections/spectrometry

That seems to work pretty well, especially when we print black onto the back side.
