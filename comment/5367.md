Hi,
so if I am understanding this correctly I only need to remove the IR filter from my camera and replace it with Rosco [#2007](/n/2007) VS Blue filter. At that point I can upload the image onto my comp to compute NDVI. That means only one camera to do all of this and not two. Did I understand the article correctly?
