That's neat! Thanks for the offer. I think I got most of my questions answered on that website. But I have another questions for her if you happen to see her -- Could new ground activity in an area increase the chances of radon in local homes. For example, if a neighborhood has a new mine come in, could that affect the local radon levels? 

I just posted that as a new question here: https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/05-03-2019/could-local-mining-affect-local-radon-levels

There's one other that didn't get answered as well about radon outside here: https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/01-04-2017/how-does-radon-react-outside
