Hi,

I have been working on the lakeland radiation issue for a few years now.  I am very interested in getting more data on hotspots and understanding risks.  would love to brainstorm ways to get a more quantitive understanding of the situation there and if we can use some form of open source or low cost means of assessing radiation levels in this area.  thoughts??
