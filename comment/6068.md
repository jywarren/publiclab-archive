Hi [@bilco1](/profile/bilco1), you can read more about it on the balloon mapping tool page, but, while the camera is in continuous shoot mode, we typically depress the button with the head of a Qtip or other found object (fish bones and rocks work well), rubberband it in place and send it up. You can also use a CHDK (http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK) on your memory card as well.
