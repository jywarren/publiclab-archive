I don't have direct experience with this, but friend of Public Lab, [@jholmes5](/profile/jholmes5) turned me on to the Amateur Microscopy group on Faceb00k (https://www.facebook.com/groups/Amateur.Microscopy/), and I've found that to be a pretty knowledgeable and supportive space (as these things go). Could be worth a crosspost?
