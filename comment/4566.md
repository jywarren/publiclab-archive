Thank you for sharing this information. Your results are very promising. I am struggling to come up with a way to capture imagery that can be used  to generate NDVI without carrying 2 cameras or flying 2 separate missions. It looks like you've pretty much solved it. I would greatly appreciate a piece of the Rosco [#2007](/n/2007) so I can test on a couple Canon Point and Shoots I have for mapping. Please email me at geobduffy at yahoo dot com. I can't figure out how to email you directly here. 
THANK YOU!!!
