Update for week 12! I am making good progress in planning for my literature review. I have found 19 pieces of literature that discuss all components of my project and even learned about the effectiveness (or lack of thereof) of sterile cotton swabs in swabbing for bacteria on a flat surface. I am going to need to modify the materials I plan on purchasing to put into effect this new information!
