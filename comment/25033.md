There are a number of emission spectra used with the spectrometer.  As an example, the instrument is  calibrated with the emission spectrum from a compact fluorescent bulb (CFL).

Having said that, could you attach the spectra?  They would be interesting to examine.  What parts of the spectrum showed the difference between the wood and butane?
