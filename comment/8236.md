Chris, thanks very much, those methods are easier. 

I think now it's time to redo some of the other tests re: the color balance. I want to see the results utilizing the poisonous looking purple color as white balance instead. As can be seen, the NDVI doesn't get into the orange/red yet as one would expect.

I used the infrablue lut.
