Hi [@raounak](/profile/raounak) thanks for your proposal. It will be more appreciable If you add more details in your proposal means different stages of work and how you'd break up these tasks into a checklist where you could submit completed work each week, that would be great. You'll end up with somewhere around 12-15 weeks, isn't that right?

Thank you!
