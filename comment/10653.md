Hi [@liz](/profile/liz), actually we didn't talk about it... I think we can name it "publiclab-brasil" or something using both "Brasil" and "PublicLab".  Another option is to "translate" the name, using "Laboratório Público", which is better if we believe that another Portuguese speakers (non-Brazilian) want to join us.
