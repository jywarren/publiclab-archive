Apologies if I was being pedantic. Now that I think about it, cleaning up the note isn't a great solution. Instead of changing this note, the pertinant information would be great fodder for a wiki which could be cultivated, watered, artificially selected, and spectroscopically analyzed.

I saw [@liz](/profile/liz) email about a high level farming wiki. This sort of content might make a good offshoot of that. I'll take a look.
