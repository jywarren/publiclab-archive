Dear jarrate, 
Thanks for your kind words. 
I'm in Primary stage to find NDVI so need to some improvements in image capture process and post process. 
But right now I want to finalize the camera lenses using two camera solution which is best for find NDVI. 

Thank you very much for giving me good reference for opencv process. I'll check it as soon as possible. 
Due to some different images is it possible to process both RGB and NIR image to alignment.?? 

Please advise me. 
Thanks in advance 

Best regards 
Kalarav
