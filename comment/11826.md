Hi Dj - Can you let me know which link you refer to? I have a few scripts that mostly deal with image classification and regression at https://bitbucket.org/rsbiodiv/. I have a lot of other scripts that haven't made it to the Bitbucket site that I'm happy to share but many are not well commented at this point. I have a couple that I use for calibrating RAW imagery. If those are of interest I can send them by email or post to an ftp server. One caveat is that I'm traveling so it might take a few days for me to do much of anything until I have Internet connectivity.
