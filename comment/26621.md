Hi, Alax! Thanks a ton. It may also be helpful - a somewhat cleaner version of the exporter Ruby code is now in https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter-exporter, and then used as a gem in https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter-exporter-sinatra, which runs our cloud service just published to the live site.
