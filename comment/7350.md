Thanks for the response warren. I will be posting in publiclab.org a summary of the work  I am doing with my setup. Meanwhile the whole thing is being posted already at http://astrophotovideo.wordpress.com/astrospectroscopy-with-a-webcam/. One good thing on using the Syba webcam you chose for the kits is that the rectangular camera facilitates its alignment.
