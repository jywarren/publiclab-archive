I almost forgot the most important addition: this desk vise which let's us precisely aim and stabilize the spectrometer -- it even suction cups to smooth flat surfaces... like a tabletop or maybe a car hood. But if possible I think we should be setting these up indoors so they can be positioned once and left for days or weeks of observations.
