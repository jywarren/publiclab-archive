Hi Warren,
Indeed the test would not find the bacteria, you need a polymerase chain reaction (a PCR test), or grow a culture.
I am not sure if this can be done in the scope of public lab.
I just wanted to mention it here to point out that the conductivity might give some people a false assurance about the safety.
