Hi [@Porternick](/profile/Porternick) 
 This sounds like an exciting initiative in your classroom. The microscope kits provide a unique opportunity to build upon multiple units within the Next Generation Science Standards. We have some great resources from our community members who have completed similar projects for middle school classrooms. Here [](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-14-2019/experiment-with-polarizing-filters-to-view-crystalline-dust) one of our users was able to use lenses from 3d glasses to adapt their microscope kits. They also included some images they were able to capture from their experiment. []()
