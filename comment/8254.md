Removing part of the image is a good plan. It is very common to have a non-vertical angle on the backside of a 3D structure (hillside). It is usually a balance of fitting the imagery but also including as much area as possible. Oblique aerial images can also be placed in 3D overlay in Google Earth (virtual globe).
