I was going by memory on the frequencies, so I'll defer to your numbers.
SnoTel might be a good alternative. I'm in British Columbia, so there may be a Canadian network as well.
Unfortunately, the Nooelec SDR I've got only works down to 50mhz. But on the upside, I located my Kenwood HF set! Many posibilities.
