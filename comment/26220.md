This post got me thinking weather it's possible to use the kind of technology laser range finders use, but at a wavelength that snow is invisible to. Some Google sleuthing reveals that snow doesn't reflect infrared very well so that might be a starting point. All those things really do is send a laser pulse and take a time-of-flight measurement (using a processor faster than the speed of light!) to give a distance. If a laser diode has the right wavelength, it's totally doable.
