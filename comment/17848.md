I was wondering if sheets could be nailed into a wooden plate. 

It does seem like it would be ideal for the sheets to be flat, so we can more easily control lighting when photographing them -- that way things like glare, lighting direction, and angle can be more easily controlled. 

Like the strips in this note, which are easy to compare due to their being flat and evenly lit:
