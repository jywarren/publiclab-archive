Dang, nice! Didn't realize this was possible with the blue filter that ships with the piNoIR. I can't believe how clear these results are. 

I'm also a computer science graduate, I'm interested in applying machine learning to NDVI (and other VI) images. I should have my setup put together in the next week or two, and look forward to posting my results here on publiclab.
