the preview of Spectral Workbench v2 with subtraction is now live -- i'll be posting about it shortly. [@ThomasS](/profile/ThomasS) - how would subtraction and division of two spectra differ, as methods? 

I do think simultaneous measurement is probably best -- so you know you have as close to identical light, and at least identical camera settings.
