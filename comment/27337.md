Do we know this guys name? This is such an awesome video! I enjoyed watching it, thanks for sharing [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic). He said it cost him between $300-$380 to buy all the equipment and didn't require additional cutting to set up. I wonder if we could make it cost less to put together?
