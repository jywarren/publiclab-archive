 I just looked up the transmission spectrum of borosilicate glass and you're right I think it's fine. I might just try the microscope slide idea. I did some tests with the new slit, and I can see that the spectral spread is not perfectly straight. It might be because the grating lines are not parallel with the side of the camera sensor, and also it could be slightly warped.
