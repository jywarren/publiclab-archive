Sorry, I got interupted.  The rtlsdr work with computer, are low cost ($5-$25) and with suitable freeware and low cost software, can decode many devices.  For example, the program rtl_433 is used with many weather stations to decide the weather data and send it to the internet. By the way, the right rtlsdr covers 24 mh z to 1700 mhz.  Although it doesn't have the best sensitivity, such a device is unusual.
