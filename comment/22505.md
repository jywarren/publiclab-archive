There have been some efforts to use linear CCDs with arduinos, which is very cool and bypasses a lot of the mysterious image processing cameras do: https://publiclab.org/notes/shubham/02-01-2016/tiny-spectromter-hacking-a-laser-barcode-scanner

Also there have been several builds around a raspberry pi camera, which is a great camera with low noise and is pretty affordable too:
