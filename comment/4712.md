Hi, Dave - very interesting... is this fairly related then to the suggestion of an "HDR" neutral density filter where we could get 0/25/50/75/100% light and achieve both ideal exposure for any wavelength as well as a plot of linearity of the sensor response?

Also -- an optically interested friend suggested using polarizer film at different angles to achieve varying amounts of neutral density filtering. That could be a relatively expensive technique if it is even across wavelengths, but I don't know that much about polarizers.
