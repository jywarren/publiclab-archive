Neat idea!  are you imagining auto placement and manual rectification, or will the images be automatically rectified as well?

for autostitching packages, you may want to look at this [list of structure from motion packages](/notes/mathew/02-25-2014/3d-data-from-image-sets-autostitching).  MicMac has a built-in geocoding feature.
