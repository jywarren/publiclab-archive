Ah - there's a bug on tags appearing on posting forms... is that possibly the issue? Indeed opening https://publiclab.org/post?tags=replication:13632,riffle,riffle-beta does not display those tags. I'll bump the priority of that issue:

I'm very excited about the posting you're doing! [@liz](/profile/liz) is offline today but eager to connect up, at the very least on Tuesday's call if you can make it. I'd love to help support organization via activity grids, and want to catch up on where you're at on this, but know you're already in communication with Liz.
