Bravo!!  This is amazing. 

This makes me wonder what accounts for the rest of that quiescent current draw ... maybe the majority of it is due to the RTC itself? 

I've also heard some strange tales of current leaks on the SPI bus ... I wonder if setting the internal pullups on the MISO, MOSI, SCK lines during sleep mode would drop the power draw a bit?  

Anyway -- fantastic, game-changing work accomplished, here.  Reducing the power consumption by a factor of 10, using only code, is kind of a big deal! :)
