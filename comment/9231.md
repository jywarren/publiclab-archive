The Speck team indicates that airflow is a big issue.  they're controlling with a fan.  If I move the Speck around just a little bit the values change dramatically.  Also, the EPA requires flow calibration before each filter test. I think calibrating for temp, humidity, and controlling airspeed (like Don's anemometer suggestion) are going to be crucial
