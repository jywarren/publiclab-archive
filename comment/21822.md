 Hi, DanielleS - we are interested in making a composite lead map that could help [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman)'s project in this post: https://publiclab.org/notes/read_holman/01-14-2019/seeking-gis-data-folks-help-us-create-a-nation-lead-exposure-risk-map

And the idea of being able to add info to it is really great. Do you have a suggestion of what kind of info you'd want to add to such a map? Actually if you wouldn't mind posting this as a comment on Read's post we can discuss over there! I think we could do something like this for the PL site, for sure!
