Jeff,
Yes, you could double the slit width and double the exposure but you also significantly decrease the resolution. That said, I've noticed that with the Android phone and available apps, that the exposure and camera focus is very difficult to impossible to control. The defocus badly spreads the spectral band (appears less bright) and the lack of exposure control appears to limit the sensitivity. The best I could do was to use macro mode, night mode and ISO 800. Perhaps the new round of GSoC code can resolve some of these prior to slit-width experiments to set options.
Cheers, Dave
