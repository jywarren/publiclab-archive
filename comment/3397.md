Jeff, the critical angle seems to be the grating angle in relation to the light path from the slit. For 1000 lines/mm grating film, this angle is apparently greater than 50Â° for slit-grating distances less than 30 cm.  I can try to determine in the next couple of days what this angle is for a DVD grating and how critical it is. What is the working slit-to-grating distance in your model?
