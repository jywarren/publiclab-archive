I think your predictions of a robot rebellion are far too conservative.  Such robots would realize their material complicity and dependency (as synthetic life forms) with industrial extraction industries and quickly turn on both their biological masters and the ecosystem at large.

if the sample is on the surface, than trailing an absorbent boom material behind a balloon isn't a bad idea. Rope ballasts (also trail rope or drag rope) are an ingeniously simple way to keep a balloon at a steady altitude, dragging a thing through stuff.
