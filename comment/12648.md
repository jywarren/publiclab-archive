Using the spectrometer and the online program Spectral Workbench, you observe light intensities.  It is not exactly "UV-Vis" since the webcam of the spectrometer does not pick up UV wavelengths, and the excitation lamp is at 405 nm, so it really only deals with the visible range.  Test it out on beers to see if you can discern the types!
