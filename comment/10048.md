[@warren](/profile/warren), oops I forgot to add my recaptcha keys. trying to create a new map from http://107.178.213.64/beta seems to work fine for me without loggin in, but links like http://107.178.213.64/beta/view/autoplace-test dont work, need to upload the keys. I'll do it in some time. 
Is'nt "create map" working?
thanks!
