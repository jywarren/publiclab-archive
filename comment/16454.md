Dear Ned,
                Recently i have been going through your interesting works on Infragram NDVI and calibration. I was wondering if you had any published journals, which i could cite for my related works. I searched by your name in google scholar however, i didnt find any publications.

Please share me any related publications you have made.

Thank you. Keep up this great work my friend. Really very helpful for beginners like us.
