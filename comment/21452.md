Ah, looks like maybe it was posted twice because the first was held in moderation (sorry, our anti-spam systems are unfortunate, but you wouldn't believe the amount of spam we get ☹️). If you want to delete this or the other one (https://publiclab.org/notes/SadiePrego/12-05-2018/water-summer-2019-queensbridge-tech-lab-community-science-project) or whatever you'd prefer, I'm happy to help sort it out! Thank you!
