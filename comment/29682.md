Journal Entry 1- Mr.Phillip's Second Block- After walking into school today i found a ballpoint pen on the ground. The writing on the side says it was made in China, and its purpose is to write or draw. There's only a bit of ink left, so its probably been used for a while. It was probably on the ground due to someone accidentally dropping it.
