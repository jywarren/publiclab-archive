This is Carlo, a STEM Magnet student studying microplastics. Microplastics absorb pollutants and carry diseases that are consumed by organisms and break down into their bodies. This effects organisms who use or consume water from the river such as humans, fish, crustaceans, etc. Microplastic pollution is plastic pollution at a small-scaled sized posing as micro contaminants and they come from things with small plastic particles like cigarettes' filters, textile fibers, cleaning products, tires, and dust. Marine plastic pollution in the Mississippi River near our school is posed with many plastics and debris in the water that poses as a threat to the environment. There is about 11 million metric tons of plastic.
