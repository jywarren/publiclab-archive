The Olympus CAMEDIA C-3040 is a nineteen year old model with a 3 MP sensor. It has a larger sensor than a GoPro, but the image quality will be very disappointing compared to a GoPro. It weighs four times more than a GoPro. To use it for NDVI, you will have to open the camera and remove the IR cut filter in front of the sensor. This could be easy or hard.

Many Canon Powershots will provide better image quality, weigh much less, and cost about the same. You can learn about some cameras that people have converted to NIR here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-convertible-cameras.
