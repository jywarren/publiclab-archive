First approach.
Now we're powering it up using a potentiometer to control the fan revolutions and begin testing.
Even though the sensor in the picture is an MQ2 (buthane, methane....) we willl be testing the MQ3 for alcohol. We're in an open area of a museum and using buthane seems a little bit dangerous ;)
Stay tunned
