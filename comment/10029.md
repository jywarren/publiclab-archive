exciting news re: humic acid skewing the spectra towards the red and heavier oils towards the blue. 

can we order samples of the same oils they're using? is Black Sea "East Swan?" I don't see that at Onta.com. do they characterize the crude? is it "light" "sweet" etc?  it would be neat to see if we can reproduce their spikes with the 405nm laser.
