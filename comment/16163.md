Also, is it possible to order this print on Shapeways, do you think? I'd love to get one but don't have a 3d printer. Anyone want to try uploading to to Shapeways and sharing a link I can order from? I'm happy to pay above cost if someone has experience setting it up. 

I want to try putting it into a sturdier enclosure and using a Raspberry Pi camera.
