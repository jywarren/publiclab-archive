Hi [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman)! Sorry to respond slowly here. 

I do think we could try for an accessible evaluation. How much would it cost to buy 2x of each of these methods, and what might an evaluation look like?

Also, what would we consider the "standard" test? 

Thanks for this listing and idea, Read!
