[@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain) as [@warren](/profile/warren) suggested i am trying to implement this system in js for Image 
Sequencer, we already have modules for canny edge-detection (which already includes thresholding), can you please provide a little bit of insight on what metadata we want to associate with the image and how should we go about this, thanks a ton
