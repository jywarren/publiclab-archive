I'm interested in something similar for spectrometer exposure calibration -- putting an LED and battery inside each spectrometer, on one side, so you get a spectrum of known brightness and response every time you capture a sample. But it raises similar questions -- are a given run of LEDs very consistent in their wavelength curve and intensity?
