You said *...With the red filter we can be fairly confident that the blue channel contains primarily NIR light...* 

But how this happens  ? As I know, the Bayer RGB act as bandpass filter therefore the blue channel receive just blue wavelength which is far from NIR. Could you explain ?

Thank you so much
