Mathew just had trouble uploading lots of photos too, so perhaps it chokes on large uploads. If you could just upload the one raw image with a red filter and the live/dead plants, that would be plenty, and feel free to post it in a comment. We just need to see this one photo at full res:

Thanks!!!
