Instead of using photoscan you can have a look at visualsfm  / cmvs, it is just too complicated for my primitive knowledge of photogrammetry.

I had not heard about any of the software you mentioned, I will have a look  :-)

One picture I took recently from the Mobius so you can have a flavour of what it can provide, at a rythm of 1 image every 2 seconds.
