This is very cool! I do wonder if TDS is going to be consistently correlated with conductivity -- i may just not be well informed but isn't it possible that the dissolved solids are not conductive, or are all soluble solids conductive? Like, could you dissolve something electrically inert -- a pigment? -- that doesn't affect conductivity? Or is high TDS always conductive?

Related: does the TDS sensor use an optical measurement or how does it work? Could you compare the 3 samples using a commercial conductivity sensor?

Sorry one more question! How far apart were the temperatures? Just a couple degrees, or very different? 

Thank you! Great note!
