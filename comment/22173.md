 Okay so I have made some major changes, especially in the flow of parsing at the front end instead of at the backend, apart from adding some new features. Please review and let me know what else can be done and improved. Thanks a lot [@warren](/profile/warren) [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) [@IgorWilbert](/profile/IgorWilbert).
