I parked the openscad design files at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mzp8gketcuqufkq/AADkG_kmo2xcL3iWYOLi4YCxa?dl=0

If there is a better place, such as on a publiclab server please let me know. There is a png file showing the result. My riffle demo board arrived in the mail so my focus over the next few days will be on it. Let me know if you need help with openscad or modifying the files.
