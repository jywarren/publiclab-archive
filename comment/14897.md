Although the diagonal color gradient is not conspicuous in the NDVI image, it is present in the NIR photo (pinkish in the lower left and bluish in the upper right). There is still no evidence favoring either ambient light or the camera as the cause.  I don't know which camera this is (Mobius?) or how it was modified to become an NIR camera.
