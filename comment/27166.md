Congratulations John!! This is fantastic news. The image is great- I love when the satellites send images from over the Atlantic. Also your antenna looks excellent! If you have any tips for building QFH antennas let us know- [@sophied](/profile/sophied) and I are still working on our own. Thanks also for linking here from your blog :)

PS: here is an image I received with a portable set up the other day in Germany, where I'm based for the summer.
