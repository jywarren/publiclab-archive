 Wow, this manual is really thorough and well explained!
I have a minor technical comment:

- P5 - Tulip picture is referred to as Figure x, Figure X and on the next page Figure Y -> needs consistency. Another option is just to refer to it as "tulip.jpg" or "tulip.png"

- Is it possible to hyperlink the sections in the table of contents? I know it's easy to do in Microsoft Word if you are making a PDF using header styles and an automatic table of contents, but I've heard it's not easy to do in Mac. Also I'm not sure how that would happen in markdown.
