Stewart -- we ought to add this to the curriculum:

http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/mapping-curriculum

In fact, publishing the curriculum as a series of shorter-subject posts makes it manageable for us to tackle as well as more accessible to people in our community, no?

Could we have a section called "multispectral analysis" where we could link to the NDVI page, the video tutorial on NRG in Photoshop, things like that?
