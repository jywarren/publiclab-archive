Here is a really great effort to come up with refined demographic survey language -- OpenDemographics: https://drnikki.github.io/sphinx-ghpages/

It's not complete -- there's a lot we can do to improve it and collaborate -- but I really like their open model!

Could be of interest [@liz](/profile/liz)!
