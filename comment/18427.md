Thanks xose!  Its been a long road, and we documented the entire process on the blog over time, including the mistakes.  Now we are working towards making DIY loggers a standard part of the earth & environmental science curriculum.  A key piece of that was developing housings that the students could build, which cover a range of deployments:

This year we will try to add more material to support other instructors, and hopefully get at least one "data" focused science paper out per year.
