Thanks, I will try!

One more problem I noticed yesterday was that (at least when I set the white balance on a red/white surface) the red channel gets saturated very easily while the other two are strongly underexposed. Iâ€™m using a white coreflute sheet as a background, which probably adds to the problem. I may try painting it grey. Still, the leaves were also overexposed many times. I will need to check the histograms for the three channels each time I take a picture.

Did you have a similar problem?
