_Reposting from Github as requested:_

I would love to be a mentor with public lab.

My completed requirements:

- [solved FTO](https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/pull/413)

- [solved help-wanted](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/4041)

- [create a FTO](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/4113)

Please let me know if there is anything else you need. Thank you!
