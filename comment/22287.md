[@stef](/profile/stef), Thanks for your observations; glad to see the creative spirit alive and well. Here's a link to a note (which includes two other links) about prototyping which might have something of interest to help your efforts:  [https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/09-16-2016/stability-upgrade-mockup-for-plab-spectrometer-3-0](https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/09-16-2016/stability-upgrade-mockup-for-plab-spectrometer-3-0)
