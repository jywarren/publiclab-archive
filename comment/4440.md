I replied to the grassrootsmapping list: I'll try to help. I'm involved in Belize (http://belizeopensource.org/news) and am very interested in solid waste management issues in Central America. Our San Francisco Engineers Without Borders (EWB-SFP) Appropriate Technology Design Team (ATDT) has an inactive project for recycling plastic bottles in El Salvador. I'm evaluating it now in new role as co-lead for the ATDT.
