I'm having trouble getting our demo Coqui to work -- these breadboards don't really last... but just to break out this one point, [@liz](/profile/liz) - you mentioned on a phone call that you're looking for more **volume** but here you are asking for lower **frequency** -- did you want both? 

Would you mind posting this at https://publiclab.org/coqui? I think I have an answer for at least one of these Qs, and will try getting this old Coqui to work to test it out.
