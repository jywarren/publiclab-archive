One more thing that may be a little odd. The tag input form makes sense above the power tag zone. But when entering, we may have to add extra code to ensure that tags get properly added /above/ vs. /below/ that box, depending on what kind of tag they are. Just noting because this will be a little tricky to get wired properly.
