Hi!
Did you tried FPV Cameras normally used in drones?
Depends of the distance, can be very cheap (25$):

The quality is analog video, depends of the purpouse can be good enough.

There are also micro-usb video receivers for smartphones so you can use almost any app to record video or time lapse:
