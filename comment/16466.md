Some blue filters including Wratten 47, Schott BG3, and Rosco 2007 are dual bandpass red-rejection filters. They require that blue light be used for visible (the red channel captures NIR) so certain distinctions among live and dead plants are made poorly compared to red filters. I could not get the Rosco 2007 filter to work well with the Mobius camera, but a red filter worked okay. The blue filters above have very wide bands in the blue and NIR. A dichroic filter with two narrow bands might work with the Mobius, but I don't know if anyone has tried that.
