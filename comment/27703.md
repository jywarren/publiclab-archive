There are a number of phone apps available for odor logging and you can probably also download an app to give you realtime data from national AQM if you're in the United States, as well as data from Purple Air or any other wifi enabled monitors. 

Are you talking about doing the analysis directly through your phone?

I think you would need a connection to a wifi or bluetooth enabled sensor for that.
