Have you found your answer already or is there anyone else with a feedback on how to know when one found the best balance? :) pretty hard to find informations on this in the web. 

[@petter_mansson1](/profile/petter_mansson1) thanks a lot for this great intro into NDVI analysis! Hope to enrich my HPA system with this to get a better / shorter feedback loop on the settings of my system!
