According to the first review on Amazon the pinout of the cable is (from tip to sleeve):

- Left (white)
- Right (red)
- Video (yellow)
- Ground

But as you say, your Chromebook probably has mic and ground reversed. So you have to cross that lines before using the RCA cable. That's what this adapter is doing: https://www.headsetbuddy.com/3-5mm-ctia-to-omtp-smartphone-headset-adapter/
