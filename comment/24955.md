Yes this is true. Is there not a way to draw polygons over overlapping images?

Getting the annotations system running, with areas of any polygon drawn in the bottom corner, would be amazing! I'm sure many mapping projects would benefit from being able to estimate polygon areas. Was the annotations system originally used for this?
