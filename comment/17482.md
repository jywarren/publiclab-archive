This was helpful and it sounds like you had a great mix of people. I've been thinking a lot about that issue of common tech form. I'm curious if most people have cell phones (even if they do not have web capability). I know in other countries that has become an important means of notification. Of course the issue also becomes power once electricity fails. Takes me back to the time of emergency captains or today's block captains. :)
