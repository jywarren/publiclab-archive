 I can think of two possible reason. The most obvious would be that the illumination changed and the other is that the sensor temperature change. Sensors like those in a camera can be very sensitive to changes in temperature which is why a number of high cost sensors use liquid nitrogen as a coolant. There are probably other possible causes but those come to mind.
