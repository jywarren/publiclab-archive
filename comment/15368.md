Hi folks, I totally agree with [@stoft](/profile/stoft) that it is essential to understand the limitations of any data before trying to present them as evidence (my paraphrase there), and to some degree may be more important than fully understanding the implications of any data too. Even with data that is photographic, I think it is important to assess what the photograph _doesn't_ demonstrate or prove too. It's a bit tricky since each situation is unique, but I'd really like to start a blog/research note series, or a wiki page, with basic guides for data literacy with various kinds of data and various kinds of end goals for data utilization. Would that be useful? Would it be possible to make it actually useful while still being quite general/broadly applicable?
