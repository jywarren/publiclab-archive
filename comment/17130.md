I just published a note today and it was also wonky. There was some message at the top of the screen that was hovering. I had to click that off. I also "viewed" the info about Creative Commons (open source stuff). Then the publish button worked. Luckily I quickly cut and pasted into a Word doc to save my stuff just in case. I'm still newer with posting too, so hopefully between all of us we will figure it out.
