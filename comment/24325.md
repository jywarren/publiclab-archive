 With PVC, as the plastic degrades, you get more and more conjugated double bonds.  Hate to get chemical, but the where the plastic absorbs starts going from IR to NIR to visible.  But it happens all at once.  In clear plastic, it will change from clear to yellow to black.  
Flourescing could show that.
