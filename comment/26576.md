Wow this looks like such a cool project! I'm definitely going to give this a go in my home. We live near Green Bay and with all the manufacturing around here, I often wonder about our air quality. Plus I'm a <a href="https://greenbaydrywallers.com">drywall contractor</a> so I have plenty of experience with dusty remodels.
