Constructing the camera case was surprisingly easy! The problem my group encountered was with the camera. We're using an old samsung and we weren't able to program it to take continuous photos. The best option we could come up with was to set the camera in video mode. We haven't had a chance to test it out yet, but it's an idea we'd like to test.
