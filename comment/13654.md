I bought mine from a Solux distributor, but I assume ones like this: http://www.amazon.com/18003-Daylight-Halogen-Degree-Kelvin/dp/B0002GS4OG are probably the same (although this one is 50W and 35W is more than enough). The 2-pin MR16 is a fairly common plug. You'll need a 12V supply rated for halogens and the bulb power.
