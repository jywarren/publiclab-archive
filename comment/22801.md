Just to get the ball rolling, I would suggest exploring activated carbon adsorption, scrubbing, and/or biofilters. These options would likely be the most reasonable from a DIY/cost/safety perspective for particulates, ordors, ammonia, H2S.

I would ensure the source is ambient air vs. household water as treatment would be different. 

Literally just stumbled on this site. LMK if I can help more with specifics.
