Hey Eymund, 
Did you get any sense of how deep the upper milky layer on the water was on the 15th and 16th? It does look totally different than the "whiting event" we saw on Newtown Creek last year as you write in this note, during which the boat left no visible wake because the milkiness was fully distributed in the entire water column. In your images, it's very clear that the layer of milkiness was "on top of" clearer water -- perhaps because the milky layer was warmer sewage, or contained more buoyant particles, or ... ?

It's wonderful that the River Project tests citizen-collected water samples every week at waterways all over NYC. I wish we had a faster bacterial test we could do ourselves on site during these canoe-based mapping parties!
