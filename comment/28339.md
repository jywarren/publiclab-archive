What a great idea! I haven't built a tide gauge myself, but there's a series of posts on Public Lab about a [water level monitor for a springhouse](https://publiclab.org/tag/series:springhouse-water-level). Likely a smaller scale than the tides you're interested in but maybe provides some ideas?

There's also another approach using an [ultrasonic sensor and arduino](https://core-electronics.com.au/projects/arduino-tide-gauge) to detect the distance between the sensor and the sea surface level as it changes.
