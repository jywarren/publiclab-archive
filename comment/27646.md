Hi [@ruthnwaiganjo](/profile/ruthnwaiganjo) - just noting a small thing -- 'A majority of the tests written will be functional for both the Dashboard and 'All Posts' page. There exist two system tests for the current Dashboard implementation. I plan to rewrite these two tests for the new Dashboard.' -- for this, the rewrite is great; perhaps in the first pass we can just add new tests, but mark a TODO to then remove the old tests once the old dashboard is removed. Thanks!
