also you probably don't need to vacuum seal the sensors. you could just cut wholes on the bottom of those tupper wear and it will probably be weather tight enough and also will have sufficient air blowing by the sensors. in my old job we had sensors out over the winter in a mailbox with holes drilled in the bottom of it and it was just fine. a faraday cage is also probably a good idea.
