The design is scaled, so if you download you can see the dimensions. But the basic unit is a 1" square -- i.e. it forms a 1x1 square tube. You're right though, we should put some dimensions on there.

Kevin - wow..... that sounds amazing and crazy! I think the mobile foldable spectrometer is not going to be nearly as precise as the desktop version. But yes, the latter will be able to detect emissions... the only issue is whether it's sensitive enough if the emissions are faint. There is some discussion of this already on the mailing list.
