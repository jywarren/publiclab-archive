Not all devices support WebGL -- my old netbook did not, for example. Are we concerned about that? 

But this is done in CSS3, right? That's perhaps even better, but what browsers and browser versions are supported? 

This looks great. You should make a function that accepts (x1,y1,x2,y2) for positioning the image. That'll make integration with Leaflet easier.
