I've found a couple systems for grab sampling. It seems as though there are some commercially available systems such as the Summa Canister, but the Bucket is a less expensive version that performs similarly. I've been adding some materials to this page: https://publiclab.org/wiki/air-sampling

Edit and add, or post here!
