For example, one hour is pretty tight. If you introduced and started building the coqui one lesson, and finished building and tested water sources another lesson.

Another thing I would suggest for monitoring is using the Riffle, Mayfly, or something similar to graph the conductivity of a water source over time -- especially if you can get two, and put one in a river above a road crossing -- and another one below the river. The kids can be involved by looking at the arduino code and making decisions on how to customize it, and also reading the data and figuring out what it says.
