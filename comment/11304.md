Heard through [@mathew](/profile/mathew) (who was excited): 

"We made a kit that had a bunch of simple, DIY accessible material parts and that could be taken apart easily and it already got redesigned by [@stoft](/profile/stoft) in a way we can mass produce: 
http://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-02-2015/plab-3-spectrometer-upgrade-prototype

We can integrate these changes within the next 3 months, and since the spectrometer is a modular piece of the Oil Testing Kit, this redesign doesn't interrupt ongoing design work on that project at all."

YAY PL design process~!
