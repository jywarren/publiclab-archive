In order to make it as sturdy as possible we decided against making the angles adjustable. The grating by default set to be perpendicular to the lens but there is plenty of room inside to shim it to whatever angle you want. The grating-slit angle is set at ~40 degrees. I can't give a more exact number than that since the grating opening is extra large to allow the spectrometer to accommodate just about every smartphone on the market.
