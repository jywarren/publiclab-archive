I like the idea of git as a publication tool. 

BUT if the backend is going to be wholly converted to git, why not just *use GitHub* as the backend?  A site that already does something like this (uses GitHub as a backend) is http://bl.ocks.org/.

Obviously performance will be much better if PL is hosting the backend ourselves - but it seems to me that starting by using GitHub as a backend would be good for a proof-of-concept.
