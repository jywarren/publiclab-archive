From Andy Baker:

"Andy Baker That is absolutely amazing! I didn't see you out there yesterday, but that's me in the excavator working center left. I was pushing out soil that we'd graded from the new wetland site and dumped in the water to create more marsh. The white shapes on the right are 'gulf saver' bags full of fertilized soil, deployed Friday and ready for planting Tuesday."
