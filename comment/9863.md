Thanks for your comment, this is what I was afraid of; there is no relatively simple way to isolate specific wavelengths and furthermore if this was done those wavelengths that were to be used for red and green would contain infrared information thus providing false (or at least less accurate) NDVI readings. Hmmm, looks like it's the two camera system which would produce more true NDVI readings than one camera with a blue filter.

Thanks again!
