There are a few places where we do math -- like convert from 0-255 to 0.000-1.000, and when repeated over many pixels, its possible that there are accumulated, essentially rounding errors. The odd thing is that I've seen matches as low as error:4, with spectra that are not the corrected snow sky reference.
