We'd also need to post pictures of the filters used on a camera, to check for clarity, etc.  This would be nearly impossibly to standardize without a lot of expense, but it would be useful anyway as long as we keep in mind that we wouldn't be able to make comparisons of pictures taken by different experimenters.
