Thanks [@Warren](/profile/Warren) (and [@Stevie](/profile/Stevie)) for this info. Recently I fully charged the battery bar but after plugging in the "traffic light" sensor, the display stayed white even with high generated PM2.5 levels.

Your ability to create a light and small Plantronics sensor-battery combination is nonetheless very interesting: if the sensor could also write data to an SD card (as it does in PurpleAir SD models), I would like to know how much this all weighs and contact my two drone pilot colleagues. If feasible, I think it would be fascinating to measure PM levels at different altitudes and positions relative to a frac sand mine.
