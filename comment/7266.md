Yes, you can download in the left-hand column on the spectrum page, it's a small grey bar with XML,JSON, CSV download links. 

So you think your brightness issues are solved? 

For sharpness, you might try refocusing the webcam. I'm not sure which version you have -- was there a wood block in the kit? If so, perhaps moving the camera further from the slit would help.
