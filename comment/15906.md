Oh, this is great to see. I know that in [this note](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-20-2016/zero-dark-thirsty-capturing-replenishing-nighttime-rain-events-with-a-trail-camera), [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) made a video from his timelapse using the same Crenova trail camera. Chris, how did you do that? Was it a pretty easy conversion?
