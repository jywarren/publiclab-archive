I would like to know how glow in the dark paint compares to LEDs. Postcards with glow in the dark rainbows painted on them could be packaged with spectrometers or sold for a few dollars a each. Meta-data about the creation date and paints used could be included in a QR code in order to automate calibration with greater accuracy.
