Yes, true. No slight intended. I edited my comment to note that 'broken' means only that the disconnect between the app and Chrome Beta is still there so should remain on the list. I'd wrongly guessed that Chrome was just ignoring the camera selection in the app and hoped that I could now use the mobile version. Hope the sharp gsoc guys will get a stand-alone app running.
