It looks like somebody finally did do some point cloud mapping work with the LidarLITE-    http://myrobotlab.org/content/lidar-lite-distance-measurement-and-creating-point-cloud
The results do seem to confirm [@danbeavers](/profile/danbeavers) hypothesis about resolution.  Either way, it gives me enough to work with and start doing some of my own experiments.  Even if it isnt the "Peoples LiDAR" dream come true, it still represents a pretty big leap over most rangefinders in current use.  So there's a lot of territory to cover for sure!
