[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) I have 6 weeks (weekends) to get this set up and running for the lake at my summer camp. I don't have the low power timer, but I am going to be seeing if I can adapt the code to use the RTC on the Riffle for that purpose. I'll let you know how it goes -- if you know of anyone doing or who as done something similar, let me know :)

EDIT: One difficulty I'm running into is understanding how to interface with I2C sensors with the Riffle -- even as basic as the pin numbers to use. I am referencing these resources:

https://github.com/OpenWaterProject/riffle_328-i2c/blob/master/riffle_bmp180.ino 

The bmp180 is an i2c sensor, but I'm having trouble understanding the 
```
// Set the pins used
[#define](/tag/define) cardSelect 4


[#define](/tag/define) chipSelect 7
[#define](/tag/define) SDpower 6
```
section and how it corresponds to the circuit board. It seems like the riffle should be using pin 11 for scl, 9 for sda, 3 for 3.3V, and 1 for GND.
