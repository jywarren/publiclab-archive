Hi, thank you for a thorough proposal! Really appreciate the deep and detailed look you've given the materials, which is reflected in your plan. I like the additional refinements you're proposing, such as an "edited" indicator on comments, and the fixed height of notes. Thanks for giving this such a complete look!
