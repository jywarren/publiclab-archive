Conductivity readings would indicate the presence of ions, but since there is so much calcium, and also substantial amounts of magnesium etc, it would not indicate whether or not trace metals were leaching. That's the tricky part about trace metals -- the ones you are most worried about generally have concentrations at least two orders of magnitude less than other, less harmful metals.
