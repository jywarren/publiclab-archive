Hi cfastie, I need a little help here. Following your suggestions I did all the calibrations required and the results were great. But in the last few days I have been trying to generate a NDVI of a park with dead leaves and healthy leaves to show a contrast. But the results have been very haphazard. I have used QGIS to raster the NDVI results. And the two images are taken at different calibrations.

The lamp post ,the wall and trunk is being detected as green healthy plants. Whereas the NIR image doesn't show anything of such spectrum in that area. Please help me out here.!!
