The ir cut filter should be on the back of the lens barrel assembly you can check for it by looking at an angle and look for a greenish irradiance, which is the filter that has to be removed, look for my research note where I describe the process. once reassembelled, the cam needs to be refocussed using a convenient barcode  also described in my note.
sample spectra in SWB under Stef, good luck
