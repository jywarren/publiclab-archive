     Due to the increased population of Burmese Pythons, the Nashville Crayfish are on the verge of extinction. Invasive species such as the Burmese Python are very harmful to the ecosystem. They can replace apex predators which messes up the food chain of that ecosystem. They aren’t native to these lands, so they must adapt. 

     Once they’ve adapted, the species’ population may grow rapidly. This causes the indigenous species’ population to decrease. Invasive species are heavily responsible in the role of endangered species. Fluctuating population makes the ecosystem unbalanced and eventually crumble.
