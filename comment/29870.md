3 Webinar Points 

1: “Fat soluble, toxic pollutants can adsorb to microplastics. When these plastics are consumed, toxic pollutants can accrue in fat and become biomagnified” 

2: The Gulf of Mexico is critically impaired due to microplastic. 

3: The volume of microplastics directly correlates to distance of the river.
