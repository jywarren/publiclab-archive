Oh, super interesting idea! I don't know the answer, but have found some related research on fluorescence spectroscopy to detect wastewater. 

There's this paper by Carstea et al.: [Fluorescence spectroscopy for wastewater monitoring: a review](http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/40126586/Carstea_et_al_in_press.pdf). 
And this study: [Using optical sensors to detect sewage contamination in the Great Lakes](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/umid-water/science/using-optical-sensors-detect-sewage-contamination-great-lakes?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects). The USGS contact on the Great Lakes project said their results would be published in a few months.

In the hospital lab context, is something added to blood samples to make them luminesce? Could something be added to wastewater to make certain compounds in it luminesce as well?
