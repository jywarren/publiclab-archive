What about having a title and subtitle for some of these pages? To provide context and other recognizable titles.

E.g.: something like but not necessarily

"Multispectral Imaging / 
Techniques to measure plant health, heat leakage, and other environmental concerns. /
Includes near-infrared photography and infragrams
