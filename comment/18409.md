This is a terrific result for one of your first flights. The photography is very high quality because of the good decisions you made. If this is your second flight it might be the most successful second flight I have seen. 

Flying two cameras to get twice the coverage with oblique photos is a clever idea. But those are heavy cameras and the payload weight handicapped you. I hope you try this again, and maybe consider something like a [Saturn V Rig](https://publiclab.org/tag/saturnv) to point and shoot one camera.
