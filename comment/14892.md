While you're worried about friction mounts, I'm worried about home-drilled holes in rods and the chance of putting cracks or stresses into the rod. 

Friction mounts can be pretty good. If I can't pull it apart, we're looking at 60+ lbs  break strength.  Is that really something to worry about?

Clearly the only answer is a head-to-head shake off.
