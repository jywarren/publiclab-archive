[@icarito](/profile/icarito) Thanks for the tip. On September 20, gmail started to collect the notifications in the Spam folder. I had checked the gmail "Junk E-mail" folder, which is apparently something quite different. The "Spam" folder is not displayed by default, but the "Junk E-mail" folder is. Now I know.
