Hm, this looks pretty good. Can you post a pic of the entire setup, including the lamp? I think using a more diffuse, larger light source (so alignment isn't as much an issue) may help to debug, but also, you may need to tilt the camera upwards more, so it's looking slightly further away from the opening. Can you give that a try?
