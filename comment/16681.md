[@pdhixenbaugh](/profile/pdhixenbaugh)  have you had a chance to make much progess on this? Here is a link to a circuit design from Analog Devices that claims to have pretty good performance.

This uses an Analog Devices processor, but I suspect this could be moved to an Arduino if desired. I'd be happy to help with that if you'd like.
