Hi Claytonb,
Really interesting analysis.
I currently use a Canon S110 modified by Sensfly for NDVI and I wondered if there could be a big difference with a camera with separate sensors - I noticed now the accuracy that the camera can offer. Impressive! I also use Pix4D pro, what are the slight modification to the NDVI formula? (I imagine they will be different depending on the type of filter) And also, where did you find the calibration board? With known reflectance?

Thanks
Alex
