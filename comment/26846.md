In the glare in the wind mill pic, left above, is a small spectrum visible, which illustrates which wavelengths are blocked by the filter: there is a gap between the blue and the pink (IR).  It also illustrates focussing problems:  these objective lenses are obviously not color corrected for the full range of 300- 1000 nm.  The pics can be quite soft sometimes.
