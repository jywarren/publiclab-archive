Thanks, Dave -- I did a degree in architecture and so spent many a sleepless night gluing wood things together -- and I agree that not all glue is made equal. I personally use Elmer's Glue-all for all paper and wood work smaller than 1 foot or so in size, and it also sets in 30-60 seconds when properly used. I'm most interested in what's cheaply available in tiny bottles, and I'm sure we can test it out if we make this a kit variant.
