That's a great review, a few points thou:
- The list of packages is missing Scikit-Image (http://scikit-image.org/) which is great for a bunch of high complexity algorithms.
- I think that each of these packages has capabilities where it is better than others, and the overlap between is not that large.
- I agree that being able to control image parameters is of great importance, but it's not at all simple (or even possible in some cases).
