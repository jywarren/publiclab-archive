Awesome write-up guys - I can't believe how much progress was made in such a short time. I think the audio stuff has so much educational potential - instead of needing to download data, put it in a graph, etc, people can just be experimenting with different solutions as you were in this workshop and get more of an intuitive "feel" for conductivity and how it changes. And when do we start the conductivity experimental band?
