 Hi Kristina, 

Some time ago, I wrote an article about calibrating spectrographs of this type. The article is entitled "Spectrographic mask for digitally recording bright source spectra". It was originally written in Portuguese, but I provided a version in English that can be read here: 

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332379640_Spectrographic_mask_for_digitally_recording_bright_source_spectra

Please, go to Section IV. I hope it helps.
