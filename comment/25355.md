Ah, well, the NDVI algorithm only compares infrared and visible light, so there are plenty of materials that have high NDVI values, but aren't productive vegetation. Plastics, nylons, etc can have such colors, which is probably what we're seeing in your photo - plastic tarps or roofing materials and people wearing synthetic textiles. You can read more at [#ndvi](/tag/ndvi) - i hope that helps!
