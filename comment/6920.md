I expect that the odd matches you're getting are because Sreyanth's code is storing overlapping averages of intensity in 10 nanometer bins, and the neon spectrum is one of the densest we're dealing with: https://github.com/Sreyanth/spectral-workbench/blob/master/webserver/db/migrate/20130820_closest_match.rb

So they're likely averaged to a smoother shape.
