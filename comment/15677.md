Oh - you can edit using the little ^ menu next to the "LIKE" button. I agree the camera model is helpful, but i think it could be added under "What I want to do", as not everyone seeing this post may know what a JDEPC-0V05 is. Or you could do "Removing the infrared filter from a spectrometer's JDEPC-0V05 webcam"?
