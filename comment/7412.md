Hi Dr. Brian I am sorry I have not posted my code yet but I have been trying to figure out GitHub. I think I am begin to understand GitHub and have posted the code I used to run the photodiode array here (https://github.com/bhickman/PDA-Spectrometer). I am currently using Energia to program a Texas Instruments Stellaris LaunchPad as well as Processing to make a GUI.
