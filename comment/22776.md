Hi! We're on `v2.1.x` -- we haven't released a new version but the latest main branch here is what's running on SpectralWorkbench.org:

https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/releases

Thanks! Or are you wondering about the JavaScript library that's a sub-component: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js
