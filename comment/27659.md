Most states already have volunteer groups that do water quality monitoring.  Many of these programs were started or are under the guidance of programs that were a part of the Clean Water Act.  Find a group in your state you can help with.  They are great in that they provide training and equipment.  In addition you are contributing to a larger data gathering effort.
If I knew your state, I could be more specific.
