Hi, good questions!

You may want to try doing a better white balance to try to get better signal from your images: https://publiclab.org/tag/white-balance

Also, what cameras exactly are you using? knowing more about the exact camera or camera sensor can help in figuring out if they're going to be suitable for this use case.
