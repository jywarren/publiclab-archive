Thanks, Dave, very helpful answers. I understand what you're saying about the difficulty of structuring a measurement of structural stability -- I'm just trying to think how we'd measure the comparative rigidity (and gained stability) of a design that's more manufacturable than maple (though as a woodworker I  do love it as a building material :-) ). Say, if someone put up a laser cut acrylic design (I have some ideas in that direction), how would we assess if it's sufficient? Thanks!
