i agree with chris.  infragram.org doesn't reflect current best practices or our research interests either, as ned continues to advance calibration in Fiji.

I've received staff push-back on directing new users to Fiji, but I want to depreciate the Infragram.org workflow and have the project focus back on Fiji.
