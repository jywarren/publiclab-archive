[@cadreia](/profile/cadreia) thanks for posting! If you want to share an environmental concern in your community or place you care about, I'd recommend starting with one of these two Public Lab activities you can do anytime:
1) Ask a Question - https://publiclab.org/questions
2) Write an Issue Brief - https://publiclab.org/wiki/issue-brief
