Glad it's working. Here is the look up table (lut) I have been using recently.  
.

*A legend for the new colormap.*  
.  
After another few weeks of trials, I think it is the most useful one I have used. I describe it [here](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-26-2014/new-ndvi-colormap), but could not link to it until Jeff taught me how at LEAFFEST. I hope this works and you can download this...

This should be copied to the C:\Program Files (x86)\Fiji\Fiji.app\luts directory or something like that on Windows, and I guess to .../Applications/Fiji.app/luts on Mac.  I will have to ask Ned to include this in the package at Github.
