Dear Cfastie,
                     Very informative. Thanks for posting. I was interested to know, which method is more preferred and accurate, white balance with your procedure( LED) or using Standard Reflectance Target. Also, how to determine the spectral sensitivity ( spectral response) of the modified mobius camera?
I look forward to your reply.

Thank you 
Best Regards, 
Suman
