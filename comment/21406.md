A troubleshooting note!

The ribbon cables seem to be the most common thing to go wrong. Often, the "pad" next to the lens, shown here, needs to be pressed down again -- and beware that it doesn't get unstuck when you snap it into the Pi cover! I've sometimes just firmly taped it in place instead of snapping it in because there's so little clearance.

Second, the ribbon cables themselves are easy to get upside down. Look carefully at step 4 to see that they're in the correct orientation -- metal bits facing the circuit boards at both ends -- and that they are all the way in and tightened. See this photo:
