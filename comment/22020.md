Folks as the call for proposal is open, I will request all of you to start submitting the proposals in the research notes section at Public Lab. We will be able to review your proposals and give you adequate feedback as soon as possible. 

[@kvaswani2012](/profile/kvaswani2012) we can discuss the ideas collaboratively. Everyone is welcomed here to share their thoughts.
