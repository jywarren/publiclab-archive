I think 3D has a lot of relevance! one of my favorite public participation in planning exercises is Participatory 3D modeling, where everyone gathers around a giant 3D topo map of their area.  

currently it has to be done live and in-person (which I think is great) but distant participants could join with a VR setup.  Also, different in-person maps could be digitized into an archive accessible through VR, building a record of the processes.
