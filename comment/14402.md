[@stoft](/profile/stoft)â€™s concerns about the effectiveness of a crowd-based and rule-based ranking system are probably justified because the active publiclab community is too small. Most research notes get no comments, no likes, and no barnstars. If an open, crowd-based ranking system was implemented tomorrow, I could probably name the two dozen or so people who would do most of the ranking. With numbers that low, artifacts will be common. The two dozen people on my list will have to be vigilant and rank any note that is trending inappropriately. My list then becomes an accreditation body, and all is for naught.

If I am wrong and many people join in the ranking process, there is a good chance that many of them will not share the same understanding of the importance of rigor or reproducibility, or even intent or legibility. 

But it might work well enough to give it a try.
