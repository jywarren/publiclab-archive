Hey y'all!  This is an excellent overview that I so thankfully stumbled upon while making a survey to send to community groups / city agencies regarding the efficacy of the Adopt-A-Catch Basin program for my other job at UNO.  [@dmunchak](/profile/dmunchak), is it okay if I use your photos as a header for this survey?
