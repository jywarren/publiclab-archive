The color gradient in the NIR photo from lower left to upper right is conspicuous.This could be caused by the ambient lighting or by the camera. Without detailed information about the camera, how it was converted to capture NIR, and how it is being used, it is hard to speculate about the cause. A photo of the same scene with a normal camera could rule out ambient lighting as a cause.
