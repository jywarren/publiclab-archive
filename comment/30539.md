Biodiversity is important because it supports all life on earth including us humans. As humans we are consumers, we cannot make our own food so we must eat producers or we must eat the other consumers such as animals to get energy. Without biodiversity we would die. Additionally, ecosystems perform essential functions like pollination, seed distribution, climate regulation, water purification, nutrient cycling, and insect control in agriculture.
