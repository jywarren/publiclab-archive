Chris, it occurs to me that we could try to come up with a way to **generate** an adaptation of NDVI based on a given un-white-balanced camera's photo of a white reference. What if we looked at the balance of a white reference and used the ratios to build our mod of NDVI? 

It might help to have Infragram Sandbox show the color balance of any region you hover over.
