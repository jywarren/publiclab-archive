Complete Aside-- 
spinning disks full of holes are how early mechanical television worked too, and Baird demoed 3-disk mechanical color TV in 1928, with synchronization between four signals (red, green, blue, synch) between broadcast and receiver.  If we can't solve the synch issues it would be kinda pathetic-- this was doable 85 years ago.
