Hi Chris, thank you so much for your answer! It seems we will have to purchase one of those expensive multispectral cameras, since we need to identify chemical compositions, microbial spoilage etc. in food and we do need reliable results. are you in the filed of spectroscopy/computer vision in any chance?
