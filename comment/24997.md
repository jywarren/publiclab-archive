Hi! Thanks so much! I'm making a special tag for [#community-atlas-ui](/tag/community-atlas-ui) for this and [@molangmuir10](/profile/molangmuir10)'s UI input posts. Also, I just made these issues based on your ideas from the call with [@stevie](/profile/stevie) and I!

* "Tagged maps collection display" - https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/807
* "Add to a collection" prompt: https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/808

Thanks again!
