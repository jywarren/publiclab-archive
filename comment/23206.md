There is a service I heard about on a TED talk at www.planet.com. Apparently they are using satellites to take daily pictures of the earth for comparison. There is also an API on there that you might be able to use for coding a system to compare the results from the daily photos. I don't know to much about that but this might be a place to start. Good luck.
