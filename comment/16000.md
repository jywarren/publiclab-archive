Hi sorry I was not specific. I built a small spectrophotometer that is connected to a small USB camera. My laptop has a camera as well so I don't know how to switch it from my laptop camera to the USB camera. I watched one of the videos where it mentioned that but I couldn't see where to click exactly.
Thanks in advance!
