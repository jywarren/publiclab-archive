Hi, [@warren](/profile/warren). Although what I had in mind was something like the Stack Overflow functionality that compares your question with questions that have already been answered by the community and redirect you to the appropriate answer instead, this indeed sounds like something we could do.

I guess we can also edit the contents of a webpage from the inspector pane inside the console? Will try to do that and post a screenshot soon.
