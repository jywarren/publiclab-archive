There have been a few requests over the years to add the capability of outputting different numbers of bands along the lines of what Chris mentioned in the FIJI plugin but it's a bit of a pain. There is a chance that a new, Python based, program will be developed that will have some options to make it easier to create NDVI mosaics of several images. For what it's worth, most remote sensing and GIS software has options to create multiband images to you can take the output from the FIJI plugin and input that into the GIS or remote sensing software to create images with whatever bands you like. You can also use ImageJ/FIJI for that but you are (more or less) constrained to outputting 3-band images.
