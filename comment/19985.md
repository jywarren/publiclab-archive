Remember - you're buying an OIL objective lens.

This means it's been designed and built to use oil in contact with the lens and the cover-slip of glass the object to be viewed is under.

This is to get around the problem of refraction through the air limiting the magnification to around 800x (when using the relevant ocular lens).

You might find you get a *better* (sharper) result using a lower magnification tube, that doesn't need an oil layer - especially if you have no intention of using oil!
