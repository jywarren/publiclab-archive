Hi, just to clarify the educational features -- the idea is that a teacher may want to invite students to write posts, but can pre-authorize them to bypass our spam moderation system by sharing a special code in a link, like https://publiclab.org/invite/123456 -- this would then allow them to post directly. Sorry, am trying to recall where this conversation was happening but can't immediately find it - if you can point me to it I can move this comment there.
