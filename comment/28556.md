Thank you for mentioning [@warren](/profile/warren), Regarding power tags and general tags differentiation, I did saw this work while researching the topic and proposed a simpler way to implement the power tags. However, I've always emphasised the need for taking continuous feedback from the user community in every task to avoid any complexity, also we can brainstorm some of the ideas before implementing and improve them by taking community feedbacks.
