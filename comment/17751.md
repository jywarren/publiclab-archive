Hi, Jack - this was a while ago, but lots has changed in some of these technologies. I was wondering if you'd considered using something like [WebJack](/wiki/webjack) to easily offload data from an arduino-compatible board (these are super cheap now, like some on the [data logging page](/wiki/data-logging)).
