I found a couple older posts that have some suggestions:

This DIY weather station by [@wjw](/profile/wjw): [Gather and analyze long term solar and wind data for my locale
](https://publiclab.org/notes/wjw/01-25-2016/gather-and-analyze-long-term-solar-and-wind-data-for-my-locale)

And this one by [@amysoyka](/profile/amysoyka): [How to set up your weather station and stream it to the internet](https://publiclab.org/notes/amysoyka/06-20-2014/how-to-set-up-your-weather-station-and-stream-it-to-the-internet)
