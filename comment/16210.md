[@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning) Hello Ned thank you for posting the R script. I'm finding it helpful to understand the process by going through the script itself. I was wondering if the CSV file with target reference spectra is the same as the table you posted on "Improved DIY NIR camera calibration" from May 1, 2014?
