I'm loving this whole comment thread almost as much as I'm enjoying Don's hyperactive circuit board authorship... amazing! 

However, given that the digispark sold for $9, if we keep things really minimal and the Scihitech dust sensor can be bought for <$5 in quantity, and we rely on a laptop and a long USB cable so you can hang it out your window while still plugged into your home computer, isn't <$20 a reasonable target for cost?
