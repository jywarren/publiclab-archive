The species in the image are gulf killifish, sheepshead minnows, oyster killifish, diamond killifish, brown shrimp, and white shrimp. These species will be affected from coastal restoration projects because their environments and ponds will become isolated, and fish that evolved to rely on saltwater from the Gulf will either die out or be forced to move. Forcing a species out of its home is a common occurrence during environmental succession.
