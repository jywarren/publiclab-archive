In the five or so seconds I had to react, I ruminated on giving the kite line or taking it in. Unfortunately, I went with the intuitive solution. On the walk home, I was pretty sure that letting the line out, or running with the wind, would have been a better solution. Its good to get some confirmation for the next time this happens.

Certainly, I was flying at the upper edge of the Dazzle Delta's range. Chalking this up to experience.
