I'm wondering if silica can be separated from other micro or nano-particulates by dissolving all particles in a solution or series of solutions in order to dissolve or separate silica from non-silica particles.
I'm thinking about this because silica is so inert. [I think glass etching uses hydroflouric acid, for example.]
Such a method could be verified w. x-ray crystallography, and then used as a an evidence supported method.
