Hi all,
following these comments, I found this article which describes what would be the project of a spectrometer onboard a drone, but replacing the spectrometer  described in this article (imspector-v10) by yours (http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/6/11/11013/pdf-vor). 
Please let me know if you have any insights on how this is realistic would be.

Thanks!
