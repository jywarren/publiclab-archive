There are a number of parts to six sigma. The different parts go from statistical analysis to design of experiment (DOE).  While there are some businesses that require the certification, I don't think that would be beneficial for public lab.  Many of basic processes they teach would be good for Public Lab.

One part that seemed helpful was looking at manufacturing processes and having techs come up with possible causes that could lead to the errors.  The D.O.E. Was helpful in a pharmaceutical environment.  As was the statistics.  How you would implement them for your work, I don't know.
