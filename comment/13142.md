The current version of the plugin only outputs index (NDVI and DVI) images. The plugin only calibrates two bands, a visible and a NIR band and two output a reflectance image I would with have to output two single band images or a typical 3-band image but that would require that I decide on how to deal with the third (often the green channel) band. A few people have requested this feature so I'd like to do it but not sure when I will happen. Perhaps in January.
