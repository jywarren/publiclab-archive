maintenance--hire someone, lol.  I use air canisters to clean them of spiders.  the units die, but are cheap enough to replace.  

I have tried to 'resurrect' a few units whose data went FUBAR, mostly by cleaning the units, but i feel like the issues were electronic--the interactions with ambient water in our area are more intense than most electronics designs, so that is probably what is going on. 

I have not ventured into the world of voltage testing Purple Air components to see what component was shorted or fried, or replacing the blue boxes to see if that fixes the issue
