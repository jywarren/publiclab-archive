Hi all- 
An update on my project, I have been researching and gathering articles related to tracking root growth and finding many different types of software that carry out this function. I have also been looking into camera sliders as well to possibly have the camera move toward the petri plates as an alternate option to the plate carousel. Here are two of the arduino powered camera sliders that I have been looking into which may be more doable design-wise.
