Hi
We have found that working with children there is no problem using our standard KAP equipment:

However, the biggest hurdle has been getting the adults who are responsible for the children to continue using KAP.  
Our use of the 808 cameras is to simplify the rigs used and to also dispel worries about breaking more expensive cameras. Balloons (and poles: http://www.armadale.org.uk/pole.htm) are an ideal way to demonstrate aerial techniques indoors, especially with very young children, before venturing out.

 It is a natural step to then move on to better equipment.
