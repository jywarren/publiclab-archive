looks great! I hope you'll be uploading data to SpectralWorkbench -- many of the applications become possible once we start sharing open source spectral data. Awesome.

I've been starting to work with 1" PVC fittings as a standard part in building setups. See this page for some of the parts I've been finding; a cuvette/test-tube holder would be great esp. if it were compatible: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/countertop-spectrometer

I really want to design a setup that will allow flame emission spectrometry that's also compatible; may have to start working in 1" metal tubing for that.

luckily lots of these parts are available in metal too.
