Normalising is your friend when you have things with very different ranges.
Depending on what you're looking for you can divide each column by its maximum or the mean, or substract the mean from the values, or "properly" normalising making the mean 0 and the standard deviation 1 ... here is a short(ish) page about normalising with Python but the formulas used are also available in all spreadsheet tools.
