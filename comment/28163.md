Some of the commercial water kits claim they work on soil. But... The lab I worked at tested clay and other fillers.  It can be a pain.  Working with moderately strong acids, for example. Then with clay, much filtering.  And then ashing was required in some samples. Soil could include these same steps.  Some of the water kits claimed they could test soil, but none mentioned these steps. 
Some kits are based on new tech and may not need these steps.  But you see my caution.
