If you couldn't upload an image when I first uploaded the link, that has been fixed now. You can upload images. Just be sure to clear the cache. I myself used edge detect on the original plastics image and got this result

My image isn't uploading. Why is this happening? Can someone help me? The progress bar doesn't change.
