Those binder clips are a great idea. I like the four different colors. Does the Public Lab Mobius come with the slide-on holder? That has a tripod socket that might be put to good use. It would also add some mass to the camera which might be useful for getting the Picavet to level itself. I'm not sure the camera has enough mass to level the Picavet by itself. So the camera might settle in at a jaunty angle and take a lot of oblique photos before a gust dislodges it.
