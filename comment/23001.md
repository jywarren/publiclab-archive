Nice idea [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) !!! Keeping in view the growth of Facebook as one of the biggest social networking platforms, I think all the points will help our community to grow. For starters, you can start with 2nd and 3rd part due to their resemblance to existing twitter issues and features. It would be really great to have any of these features. Thanks !!!
