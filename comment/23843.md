 Hi [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) these demos look amazing!
To your questions above, 

1) The gridline color in orange, with highlighted gridsquare in red looks great to me. A vibrant contrast with a blue-green planet. Open to other ideas if anyone has any! 

2) The colors of the markers might work as a spectrum, maybe something from http://colorbrewer2.org
