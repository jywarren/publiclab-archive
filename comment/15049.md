The camera used to make that orthophoto image was a Canon PowerShot A590 from 2008. These are available on ebay for about US$30.00.  It is a very good KAP camera but not that easy to convert to NIR. There is more about that flight here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-01-2014/super-redstone

The NDVI image and histogram were made with Fiji and the Photo Monitoring plugin.
