regarding the new bottles, in my search to find alternatives, it seems like even the squarest of bottles on the outside have some curvature on the inside.  Do the original bottles that are no longer sold have curved insides, or were they entirely square?  Also, are the bottles re-usable by washing them with soap, or are they for single use only?
