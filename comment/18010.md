By definition, turbidity  measures the amount of light scattered at a 90 angle.  So there would have to be a change in the optical layout from the basic spectrometer.  You also need to check the specific method referenced. Some instruments are getting quite complex ( ratio recording , etc.).  If a method specifies something like that, it can change your optical layout dramatically.  Having said that, most turbidimeters are very simple and would be easy to duplicate.
