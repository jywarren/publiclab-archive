Yes, but the common way it is done is with gas chromatography (GC) or some variation like gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In industry, these are called the hyphenated techniques.  This is usually expensive.  There are a bunch of possible certifications.  It depends on exactly what purpose the data will be used for.  

Universities will usually do it.  It needs to be one that has the equipment you need.
