Does it means if I use red filter instead and captured the NIR from blue channel, my image will show blue colour as the light is hitting on the blue channel?

My original plan to carry out NDVI analysis was in outdoor environment, however due to covid-19 I am forced to move my system indoor which I use white LED light (limited source at home haha) to replace the visible light emit by the sunlight (I wonder is my approach correct).

Can you give your opinion on my NDVI image result? Does it looks okay for you? I actually use one healthy leaf (left) and one unhealthy leaf (right, smaller) to show the difference. I increase red gains so it will be more obvious.

I am following the post on https://publiclab.org/notes/petter_mansson1/04-09-2019/low-cost-ndvi-analysis-using-raspberrypi-and-pinoir for my project. It seems like his project is carried out in indoor environment too. 

Thanks for your help!
