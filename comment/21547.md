 I've never seen FTIR used for mercury detrmination.  Usually, that is a variation of AA.  

The instrument set up you show is for transmission.  Probably, reflectance would be needed instead.  Either MIR or ATR.  That leads to a different situation.  Then, how do you ID a specific microbe by FTIR?  The common instruments can't do that.  Is there a reference you have? Or a different technique?

Please keep investigating and good luck.
