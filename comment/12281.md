Hi there,

Great article. Love the experiment.

At first glance, I think a 3-axis gimbal would help you get a lot more stable shots.

Also, unfortunately, the uDrones site got taken down, so that link doesn't work anymore. We actually have a drone buying guide with a few great drones for aerial photos/video. Here's the link if anyone would like to check it out: http://uavcoach.com/buy-a-drone/
