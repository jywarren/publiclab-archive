Hi, Justin - looks great, thanks! I like the attention to detail and appreciate your working to get this right. One thought was that it's a little hard to see the handles -- maybe they could be a little bigger? And while editing the text, could we show a slightly darkened background so you can see how large the area is?

Apologies if this is stuff you just haven't gotten to yet and seems obvious, just trying to be helpful!
