Oh, cool! To clarify, I haven't yet used SoftModem, just softserial, which doesn't do FSK. This looks great, it's awesome to see the longer and shorter waves. 

With filtering, will SoftModem be able to read a nonsquare wave as generated by JavaScript, and I guess, does modem.js actually produce sine or square waves?
