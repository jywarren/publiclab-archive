Hi Roolark - I don't have a spectral sensitivity curve for the A2200. I've been using LEDs to get a rough idea of spectral sensitivity but that's a very crude approach. The typical approach for calibrating sensors is to use an integrating sphere with a  monochromator or other light source that provides calibrated and very narrow band illumination. One of these days I'll (or someone else will) connect with someone who will let me use such a setup.
