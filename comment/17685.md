[@eustatic](/profile/eustatic), no worries -- Mathew got this pretty far (complete, perhaps?). The video is embedded in this page: https://publiclab.org/wiki/formaldehyde-test-kit#Filters+for+reliability+(optional+but+recommended). From that header ("Filters for reliability..."), scroll down until you see a video with a label on it for calibration.
