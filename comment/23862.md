 Yes that's exactly what I intend to do with the sun. Given sensor stability, and no shifts or changes in the spectrometer's build, calibration would only have to be redone periodically to ensure consistency. I'd really like to compare the result to a professional spectrometer after everything is done to see just how accurate (or inaccurate) it turns out to be.

 I plan to characterize the light using the 1st method you mentioned, by taking a series of measurements on a grid below the light fixture and taking the average intensity and spectrum. For most bulb lights, spectrum is not too variable on a plane below, but it's possible for certain LED arrays to have hot spots of certain colors. I've added a paragraph clarifying this in the research note.
