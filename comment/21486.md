 Hey  jtuhtan ! I'm trying to create a colormap like yours in matlab, but cannot figure it out how to change half of the color range (from -1 to 0) in gray and the rest in RGB. Is it possible to share your matlab script? It will help my visualize better my NDVI image. Thank you in advance! Keep up with the great work!
