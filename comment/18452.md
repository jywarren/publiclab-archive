Hi, [@AyakoM](/profile/AyakoM) -- we're sort of thinking about the SERC manual ( [#serc](/tag/serc) ) as part of our community kits program, even though it's more of a Public Lab Press project... anyways just to loop you in over here too! Looking forward to seeing a blurb on the manual and check out the SERC page that already exists here:
