I've been tweaking the setup today, its much crisper. I think some of the noise on the blue spectrum may have been from the blue light on the webcam, I taped it over and re positioned it a little bit, the blue end of the spectrum is clearer now. most recent: https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/2148
