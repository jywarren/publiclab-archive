Thanks for such a nice post :-)

I used overlapping averages to solve the x-shift problem and hence it actually averages the spectrum to a smoother shape while matching. For now a fit parameter can be reduced and checked for more closer results. In the future enhancement, the first step we need to do is 'peak matching'. This way, most of the false positives can be eliminated (hopefully). And, using narrower bins would leave out the spectrums which are shift in the x-direction by more than 10nm (since the bins would be narrower -- less than 10nm).
