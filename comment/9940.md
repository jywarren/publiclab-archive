The orig bottles were basically square, but not very precise -- sort of that wavy crude surface from molded glass. But I have a sense that there's "flat enough" -- that the laser still punches through straight and doesn't get refracted all over the place. 

I think it's a good idea to treat bottles as one-use -- that's why we're looking for real cheap ones. In part for clean samples, and in part because some of the samples are toxic, and where do you put them once you've prepared them? In the bottle is actually a pretty safe place.
