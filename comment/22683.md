Hi, at least a couple years ago, I looked into this and it seemed there are ways with a custom app, but only on some Android phones. I'm not sure if this is still the case. 

Another way is to connect it to a Raspberry Pi, and then use some of the [#raspberry-pi](/tag/raspberry-pi) photography software (see maybe [#pi-camera](/tag/pi-camera) for more?), then connect to it from your smartphone over WiFi or Bluetooth.

I'd love to see a well-documented guide for this, maybe [on the spectrometry page](/wiki/spectrometry#Activities), if you figure it out! I'm sure others would be interested!!
