I love it, Chris!  

in regards to the sway-- I see what you're seeing-- it looks like the center of gravity is off.  

Two matched cameras would definitely balance better, and I bet if one camera was flipped 180, so the two were mounted tripod mount to tripod mount, the weight might be more symmetrical.
