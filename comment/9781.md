This is the only info I get when the camera isn't recognized:
[![CannotOpenVideo1.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/084/medium/CannotOpenVideo1.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/084/original/CannotOpenVideo1.jpg)

It may be a UVC issue. I noticed a recent improvement, possibly due to some packages upgrade, but unfortunately I don't know how I could trace what caused the improvement.
