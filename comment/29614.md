From a scientific point of view, yes they can.  Even an aquarium test kit can often be used to test water sources.  The problem is with regulatory issues.  Lot tracability, compliance with applicable regs, etc,aren't covered in aquarium test kits.  Hopefully, they are covered in the stream river and pond testing kits.
