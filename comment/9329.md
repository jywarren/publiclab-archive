I've tried printing this rig a few times now and every time, now matter how I set it up first, it always comes out at about a quarter inch?  I've tried rescaling it in Sketchup, and Tinkercad plus in Repetier and Cura.  I always make sure to convert to Millimeters first and ensure it fits on my build plate.  Yet it always comes out like it was designed for Smurf Kites...
