I'm curious at how Markdown currently accommodates image alt texts, and how we could make it as easy as possible when people are uploading images (in terms of the UI design) to add them. What do you think could be done with the current comment and post editors in this regard? Would you be able to show some sketches or mockups of how it might work? Thank you!!!
