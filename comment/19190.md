Ah, bugger! I'm sorry that didn't work out! This one can check 5 pages every 6 hours. https://distill.io/pricing I wonder if you could set it up so it checks the same page every hour by offsetting the check times of a single page across the five free checks. If you and your neighbors wanted to spend a little bit of money during the summer months, I think it could text multiple people at the $9/month range and monitor every 15 mins.
