If you are looking for 1 cm x 1 cm cuvettes , they should be transparent on all four sides.  This way, they can be used for both turbidimeters and the spectrometers. Then the question is what plastic (solvent resistance) the cuvettes are made of and cost.

I have seen weird setups for turbidimeters where round sample vials are used.  The light is fed from the bottom and the turbidity is sampled from the side.
