I'm not sure about this one... but maybe we could look on the web for "increasing amplitude of 555 circuit"?

It seems to be saying you can increase amplitude with... increased voltage? so, maybe, try attaching a 9 volt battery? I warn you, i don't really know what I'm talking about so you may fry your circuit üçû
