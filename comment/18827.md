I think it's fine to have separate proposals with complimentary features, and it's OK if they overlap a bit, or are listed more than once! 

Take a look over here too! https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location-display/issues/9

Factoring lots of these systems into the API will also be relevant, as has already been started on for some of the map views: [@Raounak](/profile/Raounak) [@rishabh07](/profile/rishabh07) [@sukhbir](/profile/sukhbir)

Thanks, all!
