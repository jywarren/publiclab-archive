I hope it is not a webcam else I do not se how you can do that with a arduiono, not enough memory to hold the pics and usb stack for cam communication.
No if it is a canon cam you can load chdk on it en tirgger it with a ttl pulse to make a picture. If you want simple interval pictures do not use a arduino but only chdk. Of couse if it is a canon cam.

Do you knwo what of cam it is??
