Quick update:

Followed this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iVK8dn-6x4

And this:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=173181

And got spectralworkbench.org capturing images on Raspberry Pi Zero W with Chromium browser.

Next steps:
1. Ordered a micro USB to USB cable, so I can try attaching the original camera to Raspberry Pi
2. Ordered a micro USB cable with 90 degrees up connector so I can fit the Raspberry Pi in the original Public Lab spectrometer box.
