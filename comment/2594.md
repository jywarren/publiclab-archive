What you describe seems like white balancing which I think of as more of a normalization process than calibration. White balance using a standard target is a step in the direction of being able to compare different camera / filter setups but that alone won't provide enough information for calibration. Calibration, at least the way I think of it, is the process of converting the pixel values to a physical measure which in our case is spectral radiance - basically light intensity at different wavelengths. That's a tougher problem but if we can figure out a DIY approach to solve it that would be cool. 

Would we be able to use the PLOTS spectrometer to see if a gray card or something similar has an even response (flat spectrum) into the NIR portion of the spectrum?
