I was a bit inspired by bower's `bower.json` or npm's `package.json` formats -- and actually, one thought was that the builds_upon would link to more **contributors.json** files. And that it helps to show upstream licensing. So maybe more following the "includes" paradigm than mirroring how upstream contributions to the same software project are shown.
