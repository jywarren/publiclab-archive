Hi [@wendydelgado](/profile/wendydelgado)! Thanks for the question! I noticed you shared some information with your question regarding frac sand mining. Is this an environmental concern and industry close to where you live? 

Some intial questions: 

(Regional-level)
-What region of the US are you in, or what state? 

(Country-level)
-What county/counties are you close to? 
You don't have to share a lot of specifics, though knowing this level of information could help Public Lab staff and the community contributors on this website point you in the direction of some helpful resources

Look forward to hearing back from you!
