[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro)- 5lbs 12oz, so for mailing purposes 6lbs.  Unless the blue plastic weighs 12 oz I'm tempted to keep it-- the oval cutout in the top panel holds it in place very well, and the little rubber feet keep it quiet.

[@danbeavers](/profile/danbeavers) I have a few of those as well and we can probably include them-- they are cheap.  I also got some brass rod stock to mill small apertures through to test the concept of controlling the intake aperture below the potential size of the break in the glass tube.  I'll have some updates on that when I get a flow meter to see what actually happens with those components in the line.
