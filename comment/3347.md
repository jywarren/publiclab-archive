Great job!
An optical bench from Legos --- super!
Yes there are a lot of variables at work here.  If you want to bend your mind a bit, read some of this article:
http://www.pondpol.com/appnotes/analytical/HJYTutorial%20in%20Spectroscopy.pdf

One thing in that article is the basic grating equation including both incidence and diffraction angle.

It is also instructive to read about a basic, classical spectrometer such as this one: http://www.hep.fsu.edu/~wahl/phy3802/expinfo/spect/PascoSpectrometer.pdf
