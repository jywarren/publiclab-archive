Do you have some reason to think that the spectral output of the lamp should be different? Maybe the result you got is a good representation of what the lamp produces.

The webcam you are using probably uses automatic white balance, so the relative intensity of the red and blue channels is adjusted based on an algorithm designed to make natural looking photos in different light environments. So it is not easy to know how much your spectral result is skewed from reality. But automatic white balance probably does not shift the color very much so the result should be similar to reality.

Is it possible that the paper you are shining the light through changes the color balance?
