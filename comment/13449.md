Thanks for sharing the video.  That's certainly a lot of pollution.  One simple thing the local community could do is document how much material is dumped and then burned.  See https://publiclab.org/wiki/estimating-the-volume-and-weight-of-waste-piles

With that type of information you might be able to crudely estimate the air pollution using emissions factors.  For example, the US EPA emission factors for open burning (although they don't have a category for this type of waste openly burned): http://www3.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/ch02/index.html 

Also when confronted, the responsible parties may deny the activity occurs or try to marginalize the event, e.g. "we did it once" or "it was just a small amount".  So any evidence of this burning will surely be helpful if you can find a regulatory group to address this issue.
