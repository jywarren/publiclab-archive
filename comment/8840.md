This is a neat project-- you might try one of our [photo-printed slits on acetate](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/spectrometry/products/acetate-collimation-slits) to replace the razor blades.  if you need custom sizes, we use the services of [Camera Graphics](http://www.cgpdx.com/). If your order is too small I can stick it in a batch to make it more reasonable.
