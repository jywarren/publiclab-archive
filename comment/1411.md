Hmmm. We could still see if a single bulb could be mailed around, and other bulbs tested against each other, but yeah, that sounds like a bootstrapping problem. 

The sunlight idea at local noon could work, but it's also a little bit of a hassle. I guess we should just try one out and see how it works. For consistency checks we could ask the list to upload noon solar spectra using a piece of teflon, and compare.
