This is your box:
______
|o> |=|
|___|_|

Your pointing your camera directly at the double slit - you instead need to point it at the black of the wall (at a 45° angle as mentioned above) so its like this...

____________
|O」..........|=|
|      *       *.| |
|_____*____|_|

This ^ - is where you point to get the rainbow. :)

Hope this ASCII doesn't screw up.
