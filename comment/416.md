YES! I didn't know how to find that product, but thanks to Noah, i now know they're called Weaselballs. That's exactly what I'm thinking but I want a large one (like 8" or more diameter) and one which is transparent and has holes in it so gas sensors will work inside it.

So I figure i have to make one. 

BTW the text on the Weaselballs.com website is kind of awesome...
