More suggestions for potential easy kite flying/interesting mapping/less air traffic:

Queen E Park
Trout Lake Park (maybe too many trees, but close to rapid transit)
Strathcona Park (prob good to do NOTAM here because it is close to downtown, but further from float planes and interesting industrial land use)

NOTAM = notice to airmen

NOTAM hotline: 1-866-WXBRIEF
