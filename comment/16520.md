Yes that's a good idea. Making suggestions as a alternative to editing seems to be more accurate, because at both times we will have to load the contents of the section to `editor`. So yes I will move it under the pencil button. Thanks for the feedback. 

And yes as you have indicated showing the resolve option to everyone is also good. But could you explain me a little bit more about it. Because I'm not sure if I got the idea 100%. thanks.
