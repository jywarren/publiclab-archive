Hi! I'm not sure why it's inverted ... maybe it's more stable? A good question to ask [@partsandcrafts](/profile/partsandcrafts) folks. 

We've been having a lot of success with a 10x, as well as a 40x, so I think 20x is great. Email us at kits@publiclab.org with your mailing address and we'll send you some parts!
