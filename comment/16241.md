Hi-
If your growing seeds inside, one of the favorites of botanists is brassica rapa, which has lots of cultivars, such as bok choy. It was one of the first to have its genome sequenced. It grows rapidly inside, even with lower light levels. In cold weather, it's fun inside, as it gets tall pretty fast, 
Brassica rapa includes the many cultivars of wild mustard, e.g. turnips and canola, besides bok choy, my favorite.
