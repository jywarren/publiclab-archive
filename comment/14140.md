Looks like TWO spectra and not like a spectrum and its reflection. Its not a photo of a double ring rainbow as in a double rainbow there would be a mirror effect in the series of colours: blue-green-red-red-green-blue. The second (lower, darker) spectrum seems to have the same succession of colours but broader bands.
