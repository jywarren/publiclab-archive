We are waiting for RIDEM (dept of environmental management) to share their test results, I'm just trying to get a sense of what typical ranges are as we dive in and start trying to interpret what will surely be a set of reasonably complicated documents. 

The pile itself has been removed and there isn't currently a discussion of doing further testing at any adjacent sites. Mostly at this point it's understanding 1) how long the exposed pile was left uncovered, and 2) what it contained.
