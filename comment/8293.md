There's been a discussion of the Tellspec here: http://publiclab.org/notes/nemo/10-09-2013/cheap-spectrometer-fundraiser-on-indiegogo

There's also been a lot of posting about Raman spectroscopy on the plots-spectrometry list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/plots-spectrometry/raman$20nathan/plots-spectrometry/cPU6XDppeuQ/AsKdGEDx7c8J
