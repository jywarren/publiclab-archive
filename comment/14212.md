Hi Warren,

great! That's exactly what I wanted. A time-lapse plug-in for the spectrum capture software. (The bean-cam is nice for videos, Chris, but would not help me with my spectra.) 

I pasted the macro into the pane, set it to 6 seconds delay (  $W.timer.countdown = 6 // seconds until next capture) and hit "run". It asked for a frame name, took a capture but only one. It did not take a second capture. Do you know what went wrong?
