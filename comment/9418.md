Jack, this is fantastic.  Very clear explanation!  Could we have a follow-up note at some point soon re: e.g. how you might use the WheeStat potentiostat to assess the presence of a heavy metal in water?  That would be really cool, too!  And is there a link to where to get a WheeStat?  Great stuff!
