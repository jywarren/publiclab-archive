I found how to solve this problem, and it seems to be simple enough.
Zoom in, zoom further in , and if your smartphone has M mode, use it to make sure you take photo at same zooming every time.
And you have to adjust your device to make sure the spectrum is still centered after you zoomed in.
Sorry for ignored this for months, I just forget this thing after I finish that course.
Hope this helps.
