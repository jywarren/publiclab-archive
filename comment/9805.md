This is so great. Yes, current MapKnitter is a Frankenstein of many changes and revisions over the years. Sweep it clean and make it better! 

One note -- we decided at one point to direct people by default to the "viewing" page which has space for narrative and stats and authorship info, etc. rather than dumping them right into the "editing" page where they're immediately given the ability to edit the map and sometimes don't know that they're messing with other peoples' data. But there could easily be another way to warn people or tell them that they are actually editing. And someday we'll have complete edit history and can simply revert changes if people mess things up. We could also ask people if they'd like to revert all the changes they've made in the session, if they try to close the window (maybe). But edit history may be outside scope for your project :-)

Agree with Anish's comment!
