[@mathew](/profile/mathew) - I think at the beginning, we don't need to allow people to create arbitrary visualizations through MapKnitter.  That is a worthy goal, but I think in the short term, we can set our sights on building in one or two of the most common visualizations.

In the meantime, if people want to create arbitrary visualizations, they can write something on GitHub or post a Public Lab research note, and then link to that using the map description or comments on MapKnitter.
