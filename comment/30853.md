According to cbsnews.com/news/east-palestine-ohio-train-derailment-toxic-chemicals-mike-dewine-national-guard-activated/ the spill contains vinyl chloride.  Because of the danger with this material, the decision was made to burn it, on cite.  According to the article, burning will lead to production of hydrogen chloride ( which when mixed with water makes hydrochloric acid) and phosgene.  Phosgene was used as a chemical weapon in WWI.
