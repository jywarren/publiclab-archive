Ah, just responding here too - i believe we actually want a LOWER number than 70 cm/px -- in my response to the other comment and in https://publiclab.org/notes/pataxte/05-07-2020/mapknitter-exports-are-very-small-scale-unreadable#c26803 i suggest `0.2` -- sorry, it's a little counter-intuitive because a larger `cm/px` value actually means a lower resolution. 

As to the question of ordering the images, I'll look into that now, I thought we had fixed it but perhaps [@pataxte](/profile/pataxte)'s point is that the ordering you carefully tweak with the menu is then voided when you do other actions, so we still have an outstanding issue? Looking into it now. Thanks!
