Hi [@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker), I agree that R has awesome functionality, AND I agree with you that the learning curve is quite steep. Have you ever used Plotly? I haven't used it yet, but it looks like it might be more user-friendly and can interface with R. I'm not entirely sure how that works (just another export function, or could you export a graph that would auto-generate code to create a similar graph in R??), but I'm intrigued.
