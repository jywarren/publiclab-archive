Hi, are you interested in using a spectrometer? (Just guessing from tags) I'm not sure about if that's possible, but happy to try to think through it with you. From how far away? 

I'm not sure you could detect water molecules on the surface of wood, but learning a bit more about your goals and constraints may help! Thanks!
