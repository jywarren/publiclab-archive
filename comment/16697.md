I know that USB cables sometimes come with a barrel on them that's designed to reduce electrical interference, but I forget what it's called (I had one on my mp3 player that recharged through USB). Does that type of cable exist for the microUSB form factor?

If you wanted to power this from an electrical outlet, you could use an extension cord, a power to USB adaptor, and then a microUSB cable with one of those barrel attachments built in. 

EDIT: The barrel is a ferrite core (https://superuser.com/questions/217772/what-is-that-cylinder-on-cables). Monoprice sells a microUSB cable with one for ~$4. Not sure if it would reduce interference enough in practice.
