Hi, Dave - i tagged your post so that it's better tied into the other spectrometry research (see how the sidebar populates with related content as a result). 

This looks great. I'll have to dig in and give it a careful read as it seems like we will want to add the "auto HDR" ability to the SpectralWorkbench.org software.
