Yay! The list in that note is correct, though there are a couple other things that are helpful to have that are not shown (like the probe made from the top of a water bottle with two screws in it and alligator clips to attach that to the breadboard). I'm sending you a digikey parts list (via email) from when we made five kits for my class last year with the exact part names.
