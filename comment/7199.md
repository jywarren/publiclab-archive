I think it's a pretty ambitious vision for a spectrometer. The one they show is acknowledged to be a "mockup". My guess is that they plan to identify what kind of food it is from the spectrum, then look up the nutritional facts from an existing database they create. That's already very ambitious -- if they had proposed actually scanning and identifying proportions of, say, potassium, that would be even harder, maybe impossible.
