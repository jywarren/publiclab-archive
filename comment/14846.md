that is a very heavy tail.  I got a similar recommendation of putting a 15' fuzzy tail on the levitation over at the KAP forums: 
http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/discuss/index.php?p=/discussion/5783/levitation-light-dive-happy-in-turbulent-winds#latest

the other suuggestion was a variable spreader.  I think its not really a high wind issue, however. i think its primarily a variable wind/turbulence issue.
