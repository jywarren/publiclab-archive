[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie), thanks for this write-up on some of the issues that plague the cheaper approaches to VI. I'm not sure people are aware of this and this might merit it's own page of sorts (pooling the data from Ned etc.).

I was actually struggling with similar issues this weekend. I'm working on some synthetic images to model the camera response based upon hyperspectral imagery to see how different weather conditions and solar angles influence the data stream / image output. More on this will follow and hopefully will give me some insight in the sensitivity of cameras.
