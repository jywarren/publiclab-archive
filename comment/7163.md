Ooh.  The colors, eh.  Uf.  

Im writing a note about using a berkley fishing scale to measure the lift of the balloon.  But flickr is down.

I think there was a not on how much lift the balloon should have, which i hope to find.  And i hope that lift is in kg, because those are the units what my berkley scale measures force in

Someone mentioned at the barnraising that the lift should at least be 2x the payload.  For a kite anyway.  

Thanks for posting, i repeatedly have this problem with the balloon.
