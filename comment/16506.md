Vue.js is great!

Sorry to interrupt, but isn't Image Sequencer supposed to handle the Image Processing? The front end which was written was a `demo` (a demonstration of Image Sequencer's functioning).

So is it okay to prioritise the UI Creation over the actual Image Sequencer Library, which is under construction rather than the modules themselves and Image Sequencer's core functioning, especially when we are more interested in the Node.js implementation?
