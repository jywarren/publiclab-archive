Since these cheap consumer cameras have a lot of NIR crosstalk, especially with small sensor cameras like the GoPro, would it be better to subtract NIR from the visual channel? 

I'm using a red filter on an SJCam. I have an ImageJ macro that subtracts the blue NIR channel from the red channel before computing NDVI with Ned's Photo Monitoring plugin. I haven't done any calibration yet but I find the resulting NDVI images to be clearer and with better separation.
