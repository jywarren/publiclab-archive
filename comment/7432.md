If you use a dual-camera setup I suggest using an unmodified camera and a NIR-pass (visible cutoff) filter for the other camera. Some people use unexposed developed film for the NIR filter and that seems to work pretty well. It leaks a little visible light but I don't think it's too bad. If you search the research notes here you'll find some about dual-camera setups.
