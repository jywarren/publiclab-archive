I wonder about Military/defense installations without aviation facilities?  For example, according to the map anyone should be able to fly over the Multi-Billion dollar Aircraft Carriers at Newport News Shipyard!  Or closer to home in Maine, are there really no restrictions for flying UAVs around Bath Iron Works?  Where they're supposedly building the most advanced warships in the world?
