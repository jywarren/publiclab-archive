[@rockets](/profile/rockets) Have you had a chance to check on the cables for the isolation boards? I very (very!) much appreciated the loan of the two boards, but without the cables there is not much i can do.  

Also, FWIW, I've ordered the ORP package and the other, more complete, PH package.  It was going to cost me $50 to return the other PH sensor so I've decided to just hang on to it and treat it as a spare.
