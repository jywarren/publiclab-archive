These are some good questions. We started to abandon basic HSV because it "wraps around" -- high values and low values are both "red" -- but if you cut out the "magenta" portion of the wheel, it works a bit better. But it wasn't as straightforward as we'd hoped, so lots of people have begun to focus on custom LUTs, like [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) (who is traveling at the moment, I believe). Can you link to some of your images on Infragram?
