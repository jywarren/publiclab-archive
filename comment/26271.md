These instruments are all based on GC detectors.  So your best approach is to look at other GC detectors to see which one fits your needs.  One good fit is MS ( mass spectrometer).  It is also very expensive.  Another that might fit your needs is an FID ( flame ionization detector).  It takes a gas flame, which makes it less desirable than a PID.
