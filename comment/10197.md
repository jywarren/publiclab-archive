GIS programs are really good at doing that kind of spatial analysis. If you give them the appropriate information, they can scale and correct the aerial images so they relate to a map (orthorectification). Then they can report the area of each color that is present in a given part of the image and convert that to area on the ground. Other types of image manipulation programs can report about pixel counts of different colors, but might only provide relative numbers without absolute area measurement or correction for non-vertical photos or non-flat terrain.
