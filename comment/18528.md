I would suggest getting a little familiar with leaflet blurred location, and its demo. Also our main task would be adding information to our maps using tags, like project description, # of people, etc. Also we need to maintain subscribers list for regions, or boxes in our case. Please have a look at my proposal and leave any comments on what features we can enhance even further.Also the proposal looks really good to me. Thanks :)
