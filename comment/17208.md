Sorry to miss some of this as I was away last week, and just catching up again now. This looks really great! Sorry if I missed it, but were you able to see a periodicity to the noise on the last flight that could support your idea that the picavet cross movement was a contributing factor? Just a thought. 

I'm still looking for the Kestrel. Not super hopeful at this point but I'll give you a heads up if I find anything. 

I love seeing the altitude gain following the wind boost. That seems like a reasonable correlation. 

Great work, Chris!
