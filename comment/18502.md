One place to find these kind of devices is at pittcon.  It is THE convention for analytical chemists.  It takes place in Orlando, Fl on Feb 26- Mar 1 and it is expensive.  I'm not going.  Don't know if you have a friend who is going and could keep an eye open for you.  Maybe the pittcon website will give you what you need.  
If a friend does go, they usually call these compounds volatile organics. He should keep an eye out for any devices that will detect volatile organics or v.o.c.s
