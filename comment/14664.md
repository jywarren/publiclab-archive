While working on my Riffle beta datalogging program, I also corrupted the micro SD card. The Riffle was no longer able to initialize the card. Strangely, the card did seem to work when plugged into my USB card reader. I fixed the problem by using the Repair feature of the Disk Utility application on my MacBook. Now it's working again when installed in the Riffle.
