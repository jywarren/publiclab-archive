Hi, I think you could use the JavaScript version, SpectralWorkbench.js, to get an offline CSV of data - https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js

Then you could graph that... it's not as powerful as the online suite but it has image => data conversion. I do wonder if it's possible for a JavaScript person to build an Electron app around it, but we haven't had resources to pursue that.
