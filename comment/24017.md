Hi [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman) - just dropping some links in here after chatting! 

Very cool rigorous field evaluations of many many air sensors:

http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluations/field

I think I described it as "empirical and egalitarian" haha - they test $100 things and $10,000 things the same way, and even DIY projects off Kickstarter are assessed as "seriously" as a high-end system. I like the idea that nobody gets special treatment. 

And the Oil Testing Kit Beta Program I mentioned is here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit-beta

I'll send you a copy of the booklet!
