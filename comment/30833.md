Trying to substitute this link in for the old Civic Hall blog link:
http://web.archive.org/web/20180614162508/https://civichall.org/civicist/need-talk-talk-community-led-disaster-response/

Tried working in pure markdown mode, and loading the page in an incognito window (to avoid caching), but not seeing it update. Thanks!
