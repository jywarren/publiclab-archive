This is a really well crafted proposal. With your track record on MapKnitter and PublicLab.org, we have confidence in your ability to do it! 

My worry is -- is there any way to bring your DevOps experience closer to our high priority projects? SWB is relatively dormant and stable right now, to be honest. Are there optimizations to the MapKnitter exporter system that could be made, esp. with tuning the containerized export processes?

I'm mainly thinking about this because we are likely to have significantly fewer slots this year, and will likely face some tough choices when we get to project selection. No reflection on the quality of the proposal, which we think is great on its own merits!
