Hi, I am new to spectometry and was wondering if the spectrometer built with the kit could detect fetanyl in street drugs.  In my comp sci class at university this term, we are using the Atmel SAM4S Xplained Pro with which I thought I could build a spectrometer for this purpose (either with or without the kit).
