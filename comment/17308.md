hi [@aldehyde](/profile/aldehyde) great question! you can follow this link to beta test the app https://u.osu.edu/smartform/beta-test/

yes, after the beta testing is done we will validate the badge and app in an exposure chamber. Following that we will be running a case study in Waycross with working badges and hopefully our industry partner will be offering the badge for ~$5. What scale of monitoring were you hoping to do? Thanks again!
