There are variations on the method, but check out the USP if using for medical applications.  The oldest is a straight " gel clot".  The sample is compared to standards that look like a faint white clot to a severe white clot. The turbidimetric was better in quantitation, but both the gel clot and turbidimetric took a fair amount of time to run.  Maybe the newer methods are better.  Never observed the chromogenic method. Here is a quick  presentation by Tim Sandle of Bio Products Labs to get you started :https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299507542_LAL_Choice_of_Test_Method
