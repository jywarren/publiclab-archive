[@csteran](/profile/csteran) actually image-sequencer has the capability to run a sequence of processing steps on an image and provide output of each step separately or just the final image based on user's choice, also I will make a research note for running Image-Sequencer on raspi and link it both here and in the documentation,
Thanks :)
