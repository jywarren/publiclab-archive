[@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) OK, ty for the response. Sounds like I need to check manufacturers about the copper tape to see how pure it is. Also, I was thinking of mounting under an awning or creating something like a plastic dome (similar to a squirrel baffle). However, I could also try mounting the copper tape to pieces of plastic like upcycled milk jugs. That way I would only have to worry about the copper tape adhesive failing in humidity.
