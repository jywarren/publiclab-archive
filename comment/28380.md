Also, Chris Brantley at the Corps of Engineers has a history of mitigating the algae blooms in the lake, by changing how the spillway is operated.  in 1997, there was a collossal algae bloom, and the Corps has worked, somewhat, to prevent that from happening again. I think they must be doing something right, as the algae hasn't ever been that bad again, despite the record flood in 2019.
