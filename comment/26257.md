Just talking to our education manager about your idea, she suggested possibly setting up long strips of sticky tape and using acetone to remove the particles from the tape, then distilling that solution (though I'm not sure how difficult, safe, or practical that might be). 

I was also thinking that large panes of glass might have enough static electricity to collect particulate matter that could easily be wiped off. You'd probably end up with more car exhaust and brake dust than anything.
