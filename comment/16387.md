Thanks for the feedback and appreciation, [@warren](/profile/warren) and [@stevie](/profile/stevie). I've thought over some of these issues, and would definitely love to discuss those. But commenting on this thread might not be our best option. Whenever you're free (if you're free at all) I would love to talk about these and any other issues you guys have in detail.
