Hi [@rohaidb](/profile/rohaidb),
I really like the mock-ups ❤️ ❤️ 
I like the structure of your proposal, I like the way you have explained the tasks and solutions on the weeks, It feels like a discussion, which I really enjoyed reading.
On the weeks(e.g `Week 1`) maybe bold them or add some white spaces between the weeks for an easier find. You could also add a lsome description of the Infragram project and how its relation/effects of this project on the "Project description" section. 
Great proposal  and thanks for posting
