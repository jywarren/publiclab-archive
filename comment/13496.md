As to time-averaging, I think it'd be pretty easy to implement, but would ONLY work if a spectrum is really vertically aligned -- so no uploaded spectra which are not from the live capture "waterfall" graph. I'm not sure how to make that extra clear so folks don't just time average and smear their data.
