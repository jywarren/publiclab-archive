Hi [@silentsairam](/profile/silentsairam) I did all of those steps but it didn't work! I think [@warren](/profile/warren) is right - although it is strange that when I test ran it I could download a zip of my 10 photos very easily.
I did try putting the SD card in directly but there is no DCIM file or jpegs or anything that is recognised by my laptop as photo files. I'm assuming I'll need to convert them but do you know what file format they would be in?
