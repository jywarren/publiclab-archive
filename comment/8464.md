Sreyanth - can we or shall we send you at least a foldable spectrometer so you can test this stuff out? Do you have a webcam you could use with it?

Sorry, i haven't had more time to respond to this post; just trying to get through all the GSOC postings and am traveling and working on the road this past week. Forgive me! I'll see if I can jump in and give more substantive feedback soon.
