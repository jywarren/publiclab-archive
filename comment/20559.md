Isn't he doing not a 24 h average, but a week average in this case? That sounds like it would have merit.

One thing I'm legitimately curious about: let's say air quality is consistently in the orange levels between 12 and 5 pm each day, but improves overnight. Could this be cumulative environmental exposure, but with daily averages in the healthy range?
