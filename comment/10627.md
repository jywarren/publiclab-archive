Pulling line in automatically requires two things-- a line that doesn't stretch much, and a strong enough winder. 

The reason for the not-so-stretchy line is that if wound under tension, the spool is liable to crack. the pressure can be enormous.  A strong spool is also importnant.  I'm sure it would be possible to build a de-tensioning winder, but they are generally very bulky.

with kites, I prefer having manual control, even if I'm using a big cranked spool.  kites are sensitive and I prefer feeling the tension as I wind.
