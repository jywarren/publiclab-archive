Great designing [@divyabaid16](/profile/divyabaid16) .
I agree with [@lekhidugtal](/profile/lekhidugtal) , that the footer looks a bit cluttered. Adding long sentences in the footer creates a lot of problem on small screens. I think we can keep it to 2-3 words max. 
The footer examples given by [@lekhidugtal](/profile/lekhidugtal) are great. To add to that, I really like the footer of if-me website.

Thanks!!
