Ah, I overlooked that it was softserial in your case.

Yes I think modem.js produces sine waves. At least there is a sine function in the [code](https://github.com/dolske/modem.js/blob/master/afsk-encoder.js#L308) and when I look at your record of modem.js it makes totally sense, as there are two relatively sharp lines.

I'll try to get my hands on a headphone connector in the next days, so I can answer the open questions.
