Dear Dr. Jack,
I get this error whenever I run your DigitalPotCheck:

{
sketch_mar15a.ino: In function 'void digitalPotWrite(int, int)':
sketch_mar15a.ino:87:7: error: 'class SPIClass' has no member named 'trans2ByteA'
sketch_mar15a.ino:88:7: error: 'class SPIClass' has no member named 'trans2ByteB'
}

I already have the altSPI library in my energia library folder.What do I have to do?

Thanks!
