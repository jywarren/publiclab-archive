This is really great! I would also recommend NOAA's Climate Data Online Tools (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools) to people interested in looking for historical weather data: it's way more user friendly than it used to be, and there are some cool options for visualizing data if you need something to drop into a presentation or report.
