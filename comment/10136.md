Theo,
I have gotten that error too, even when using my own pairs of simultaneous photos (I think the cameras' clocks were way off). I forget what I did, but for just a few pairs I often make the list of photo pairs by hand.

You can ask questions like this at the Public Lab infrared Google Group (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plots-infrared) or in this case you could add to or start an issue at Github: https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin/issues.
