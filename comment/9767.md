theowallis, Did you add a new filter to replace the IR block filter? Where did you put it?

Do you think it is the act of tightening the set screw that moves something and loses your careful focus? Or the act of closing the case?

I did not fully tighten the set screw, and then did fine focus adjustments after everything was put back together. That seemed to work well. 

It seems unlikely that you broke something (other than the old IR block filter) or that the old filter has a mechanical influence on focus.
