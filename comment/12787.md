Regarding humidity, we've talked about offering an upgrade with a sheet-plastic material, die-cut the same as the paper edition. I hope we figure out how to do this. [@tonyc](/profile/tonyc) - this post is a good overview of assembly of the OTK and Spec v3, and some good thoughts for revisions as well. Thanks Tofu!
