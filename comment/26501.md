Hi [@suyash1814](/profile/suyash1814), great proposal ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ Love the mockups and code snippets.

You can make the code snippets more apparent by wrapping the code with "``" .
I would like to see links to the contributions you have done(PRs and issues) and you could tell a little bit about yourself at the top(totally optional) .
Is Microsoft's Azure Computer Vision API open source?  we mainly use open source tools so just checking. Thanks
