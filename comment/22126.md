We actually have a great wiki about how to host a Barnraising (https://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-host). [@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) , one of our organizers in China may have some advice as well-- they put together a great Barnraising last fall! You can see a little more about that here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-guangzhou-china (scroll down for English lang version).
