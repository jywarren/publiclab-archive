[@warren](/profile/warren) great suggestion! It rains a lot here so I'm somewhat worried about that too. Where can I find that conversation? Are there any inexpensive DIY moisture indicators to test how effective the setup is? (There was something we used in chem lab dessicators that changed color when it absorbed moisture.
