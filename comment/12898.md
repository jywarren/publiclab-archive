Sorry - for those using HTTPS/SSL, the embeds won't be working at the moment, as we just upgraded PublicLab.org to use extra security, but haven't yet done the same for Spectral Workbench. We should have this resolved shortly.

This is very exciting work, Matej - I wonder if you could estimate the dilution of a field-collected sample by trying to use the minimal # of drops of an oil to reproduce a sheen. But that sounds like it'd make a toxic mess. Perhaps doing a surface collection from the Gowanus, or an oily puddle on a rainy day could be a real-world analogue of your tests here. 

Keep up the great work!
