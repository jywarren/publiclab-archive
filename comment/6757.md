This is excellent! thank you for pursuing this project.  Have you considered using solar hot air balloons instead of helium? it would lower your altitude to about 20,000ft, and they can't fly at night, but they only cost ~$5-10 per flight.

e-mail me (mathew at publiclab) your address and I'll mail you a 12' balloon envelope.
