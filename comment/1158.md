I'm kind of thinking the longer plate as pictured above could work well, esp. if combined with permanent double-sided foam tape. If you don't want to attach it directly to your phone, anyone can buy a case for their particular phone, and attach to that. I think some careful work on the shape of the joint could prevent light leaks -- maybe some kind of internal flange...

...but i drew the lower design wrong since it couldn't fold backwards past that flat part at the joint.
