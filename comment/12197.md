Yes, I have a few more slits; no worries. It was late at night and stupid of me and I just thought others might enjoy a laugh at my expense. :-) 

Such a laser diode and driver can be had for less than $100 (probably far less for those with better connections than random ebay sellers) and can be stuffed in a pocket flashlight case, powered by cr123 batteries. A fun (albeit dangerous) toy!
