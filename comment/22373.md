Hi! Thank you for helping debug, and for being an open source supporter! Seems to me like some instructions got lost in the wash, so i'll type them in here real quick: 

(1.) On Android use the Firefox browser. Only this browser lets you choose the rear camera. 

(4.) After solving [#1](/n/1), there will not be tape on your front screen!
