OK, still interested if that's possible. 

Re: film - you can prob. get a cheap roll of color film, pull it entirely out of its roll, roll it up, and hand it to the 1 hour photo place. That's good for some shocked looks too :-P 

I was able to get film for $3.50 and get it made into negatives for $3.
