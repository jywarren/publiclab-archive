In markdown, leaving a single blank line between two blocks of content produces a single blank line between the two blocks of content. If you want a carriage return without an extra blank line, end a line with two spaces. 

I guess these targets with QR codes would be used before and/or after a flight. They would be too small to place in the scene to get captured in the mapping (or other) photos.
