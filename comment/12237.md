I've been slowly building a "buoyancy-driven underwater glider" robot, as an extension of the thermal fishing bob concept.  It now has a dedicated research page if anyone is interested- http://publiclab.org/notes/ajawitz/07-11-2015/buoyancy-driven-underwater-glider.
  My goal is to use it as a platform for various open-water tools in development incl. RIFFLE and the Thermal Fishing Bob.
