Wow, chris, this is pretty incredible, and not only because of the soundtrack...

The lead image is amazing!! Especially how suddenly it changed since we were there.

BTW I looked up that bolete mushroom and it was not only edible, but is known to be soggy when mature. The usual way to prepare it is to cut it into strips, dry it, and then cook it. Missed opportunity.
