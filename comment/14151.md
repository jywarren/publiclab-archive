Wonderful work- I can't imagine counting particles while sizing them, etc.
So cheers to the coders.
With regards to the difficulty of visualizing light particles on a dark background, I encountered the same problem with trying to make silica dust visible on photographs.  In order to see the dust using threshhold filter, using black & white images, applying the inversion filter first worked well. Inversion turns black into white, light gray to dark gray, etc.
I thought it was easier to start taking photos in b & w, or converting them to b & w. Inverting color is interesting, but it didn't help me when viewing small bright particles of silica sand for evidence of fugitive dust.
