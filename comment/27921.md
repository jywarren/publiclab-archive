I use rtlsdr hardware with a pc.  The software is sdr# and argo, although there are a bunch of other ones you can use.  I listen to a tv station still broadcasting normal , not digital, transmissions.  These are tv stations getting rare, especially the ones using channel two or three.   This is for optimal meteor detection.  But there are other options. Usually, just using different software.

You may want to check out SARA(society of amateur radio astronomy).  They do a lot with radio astronomy.  

Good luck
