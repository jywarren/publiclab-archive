Thanks Patrick,

The table and graphs are screen captures from Excel. The graphing module in Excel is very powerful in part because it has a huge number of data presentation and formatting options. Unfortunately, it can be burdensome to figure out which options provide the type of graph you want. Maybe that's true of any graphing module.
