Just going down that road a little bit further.  What distance do you need to cover and at what data rate?  There are wireless bands on   900mhz ISM ( industrial, scientific, medical) as well as FRS, MURs, GMRS bands. Some, like GMRS, need a license, although it's minimal.  Others are license free but have to accept any interference. And don't forget the old CB frequencies and the 49 mhz walky talky freqs.  I don't hear much on 49 mhz any more, if you need relatively short range and low data rates.
