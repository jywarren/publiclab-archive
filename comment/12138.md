When the team I worked with at the Berkeley School of Information was working on our thesis project we looked a lot at how to build intrfacws that encourage easy, low effort contributions to bring someone into a community. One thing we built into rhe platform we developed was modularity on projects. Someone could start a project and add content (such as a Mapknitter map, text, other photos/videos) and they would own that project. But anyone else could request access to the project to submit to it. They might kit have much to add, but it would make them feel more connected than just commenting, since it feels more like a real contribution. Our platform was obviously for a different audience/purpose than public lab, but making it easier for people to collaborate and contribute to each other's work is one option.
