I'm also posting a new issue for [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)'s suggestion:

> That click vanished the note I was working on which did not seem very fair. I don't know much about GUIs, but that link "For the legacy editor, click here" should definitely not have been at the top of the page for all this time if it deletes your work whenever you click it. So from then on I just used the legacy editor for all my notes.

Thanks!
