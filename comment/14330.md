I believe both Excel and Quattro Pro provide for multiple plots. I suspect your's may as well -- in Quattro it's under the specialty xy plotting. I'd be surprised if any spreadsheet didn't offer to plot multiple columns of data vs a single column for X. Google search indicates you just need to use LibreIOffice's XY plots.
