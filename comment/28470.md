Hi [@lilymccraith](/profile/lilymccraith), nice to see you here! 

Great question about alternative parts for the Simple Air Sensor. I'm not sure of the answer myself, but would you be interested in posting this as a separate question post? Hopefully we can get more eyes and input on it! If you follow the "Click here..." link under your comment, it should take you right to a question post form.
