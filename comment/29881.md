Caleb Hall- 3/29-2022- 
Estuary: the mouth of the river, the part where the tide means the stream. An example of one would be the Mississippi River Delta Basin 

 
Three initiatives that have been put in place that have a direct impact on our estuaries include the construction of structure designed for water management, placement of culverts, and breaking sections of spoil banks along man made cannals.
