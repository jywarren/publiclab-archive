Unfortunately those values would only work if you had the same materials that I used. To get the reflectance values you would either need to fine someone with a spectrometer who could scan your targets and give you the reflectance values for the wavelengths suitable for the filter you are using or purchase targets that have documented reflectance values which is usually quite expensive. Getting calibration targets that have known reflectance values seems to be the biggest hurdle for the calibration process. Most universities have spectrometers (lab and or field) so maybe if you ask around you can find someone to help.
