There have been a few discussions about whether or not one could use OpenCV for 3D Orthomosaic mapping, but beyond that I've yet to find any open source solutions for Photogrammetry or 3D Orthomosaic.  Nor have I discovered any turnkey proprietary solutions that cost under $70.  Nevertheless, its good to know that a software approach is possible.  Even if the notoriously complex OpenCV is the closest thing we have to an open source option.
