Juan, good find.  Jeff is now going to know before any of us if someone has been spraying Roundup on our plants.

I guess it costs more than $14 to buy a roll of color slide film and get it developed.  You might have to find a light source without much green in it so the camera's green channel gets very little light. Then use the glasses as a filter for the camera and shoot towards the light.  You can measure the spectral response of the glasses and then see if the developed slides are the same. Then we can all have plant stress visors like Geordi.
