[@Gianni_Gadaleta](/profile/Gianni_Gadaleta) - I never did get the chance to have the Komatex scanned so I haven't used it for target material. Becky Done with SABIC Polymershapes (rebecca.done@sabic.com) is a great contact for Komatex if you want to have some samples sent to you to test. I think it is very much worth pursuing. I have not pursued it further because I was able to get some affordable targets from Labsphere(http://labsphere.com/labsphere-products-solutions/materials-coatings-2/coatings-materials/permaflect-1/)
