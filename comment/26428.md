From Mallory on the Purple Air team: "When a user registers their PurpleAir sensor, they select the location that they want the sensor icon to appear on the PurpleAir map. If they do not want the sensor icon directly on their home or the true installation location we recommend placing the sensor at the nearest intersection or in a neutral location like the center of a road, etc."
