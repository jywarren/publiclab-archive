Re:the ammonia problem- Amazon sells api ammonia test kits for fish tanks.  The cost is under $7 for 130 tests ( be suspicious of this number, though). They show a color scale that the solution should change to( different shades of green).  Hopefully, this could be modified to use the public lab spectrometer, although you would probably need a continuous spectrum source.  You might be able to save money ( by using less volume)or get more accurate results- don't know.  Hopefully this could be used for regular water.  Any ideas?
