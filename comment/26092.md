Yes, I have a lot of experience with a number of types of gc.

First, if you are talking about buying a frog 5000, realize that you are really talking about setting up a certified lab.  Which means sops, certifications, and a bunch of other things.

The frog 5000 is a very unique gc.  Most gcs use helium or hydrogen as carrier gases.  The frog uses air.  It leads to less than ideal separation, but saves a lot of money. 

 The frog uses a pid as a detector and ids the compound by retention time.  This is not good.  With chromatography, the usual rule is retention time and spectrum are used for a no argument match.  This usually means a mass spec detector and a lot of money.  There are exceptions, but in court, mass spec holds up better than pid. 

It's a start.  

Good luck.
