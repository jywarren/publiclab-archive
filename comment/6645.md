[Mathew](/profile/mathew) and I are getting ready for the smartphone spectrometers to ship and are printing slits on photographic printing plates (mathew probably knows the nomenclature a bit better) like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_to_plate 

This is nice because it means we can be **super** precise. I think we may start shipping several different slit widths in each kit so people can choose. This idea was based on Dave Stoft's idea to [use inkjet printed transparency as attenuator material](/notes/stoft/05-14-2013/in-search-of-spectrometer-attenuators), in a related idea.
