Hi Mathew,

You and JSummers have a huge amount of very interesting projects. 

I have been studying electrochemistry, but I still have a lot to learn. Especially the operation of a potentiostat.

I confess that I still can not see how to use a potentiostat to make chlorine potentiometric measurement.

The Standard Methods (www.standardmethods.org) include the following methods for chlorine analysis: colorimetry  (Standard Methods 4500-Cl G, H), titration (Cl-4500 Standard Methods B, C, F), amperometry (Standard Methods 4500 -Cl D, E) and indirect potentiometry (Standard Methods Cl I-4500).

I suppose that a potentiostat could be useful for amperometric measurements. Right?
