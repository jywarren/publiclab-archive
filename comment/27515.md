Thanks [@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain) 

My full spectrum LED lamp produces some light in the IR spectrum as well. However, I do not want to have a too high intensity in the red spectrum so my plants don't flower. Also - I think - Incandescent type lamps are a lot less energy efficient than full spectrum LEDs which is a huge deal in my setup or did you experience otherwise?
