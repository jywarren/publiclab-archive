I ran your fix and got a little further but I'm running into this issue now too:
2020-12-10 23:02:43,724 INFO  [noaa_apt::gui::gui] GUI opened
zsh: segmentation fault  ./target/release/noaa-apt

UPDATE: I am running Mac OS 11.0.1
Do you have an idea why it keeps crashing?  You know it never asked permission to access my Downloads folder.
Thanks!
