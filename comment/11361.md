Hello All -- gpenzo, Ecta64, warren, mathew!
Thank you very much for your interest. I'm working now on the note about these balloons, and resizing the photos. In brief, we use the polyethylene for the envelopes. Also, our point, the balloons are sort of 'semirigid' -- the belly is framed with carbon fishing rods.
