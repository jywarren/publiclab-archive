"The lens is very wide, so stitching maps from multiple low altitude photos produces poor results"

Sorry for not being clear enough.  Gimp + Bimp allow you to automatically (batch) take the barrel effect out of every Mobius picture, making Mobius pictures "stitchable".

For instance, this was done from a few hundred Mobius pictures with barrel effect out thanks to Gimp + Bimp : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK-3joqFIWA
