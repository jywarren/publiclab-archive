[@jeffh](/profile/jeffh) - do you think it'd be possible to do such analysis using a blue or ultraviolet LED, instead of a laser? I wonder if it would be safer (for the eyes) and also cheaper/easier? It'd certainly be easier to build it into a smaller testing setup -- maybe even something that fits on the mobile phone version of the spectrometer.
