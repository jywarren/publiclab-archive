Just a word of caution: kites can be harder to maneuver if you're in an area with a lot of buildings and trees-- they typically require more space to launch, and maneuvering a kite so that it flies over a particular site can depend a bit on your ability to position yourself in relation to the wind-- you may find that your kite is more stable at a higher altitude, but this can be hard to acheive if you don't have access to some open space (this is one of the reasons folks tend to favor balloons in closer quarters/lower altitudes). That said-- it's not impossible! You might want to do some test flights without a camera in your location to get a feel for things. If you *do* end up considering balloons/helium, I think that [American Compressed Gasses ](http://americancompressedgas.com/pages.php?page=products) in Maspbeth is your closest bet.
