[@david-days](/profile/david-days), right. So, I have a theory ... right place for theories, right? ... that having a diverse source of contributors means just as diverse "level" (broad definition) of "material". Therefore, it's like painting a tree where the challenge is how to filter that material into the appropriate branches, twigs, leaves, etc of the tree. All *can* be useful (even those that form examples of wrong turns) but only if placed in the correct location. Right now, it's a bit too similar to hearing cats.
