Just noticed -- in that last plot, it looks like the 'falling times' (top curve) start 'slumping', whilie the 'rising times' (bottom curve) seem relatively steady -- is this because of differences in scale?  Why would this be?  Are 'rising times' (the time taken to charge the capacitor) relatively impervious to polarization effects?  If so -- and I don't understand why this would be the case -- can we exploit this to assess the impact of polarization in our circuit?
