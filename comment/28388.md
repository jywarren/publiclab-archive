Yeah, you are correct. Irrespective of that, we can say electric vehicles only have a slight advantage over gas vehicles. Any reduction in emissions from the likes of electric vehicles will be offset by the increased use of power plants to charge them. Talking about solar energy, a very less percentage of the world uses solar energy and I don't think we can use solar energy to run our vehicles as of now because the energy produced by solar energy is very less. We can only charge our mobile phones using solar energy, not our cars as of current standards.
