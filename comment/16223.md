So my million dollar question do I buy 3 or 4 inspire 2.0 with extra batteries or go for the new Ebee SQ ag drone for 12-15k with the multi spec with up to 500 acres at a throw. I like the one hit wonder, but i like redundancy and flexibility of a VTOL offers,   mainly we are wheat,corn,soybeans here with possible of some surveying and site scanning. Please, your thoughts .....
