Whoops, oversight on the tar/gz formats. They're allowed now!

Great article. I've never looked at a neon lamp with my spec.

BTW it reminds me to add units to the graphs at [SpectralWorkbench.org](http://SpectralWorkbench.org). I think in nanometers; i'm sure others may prefer angstroms or even wavenumbers...
