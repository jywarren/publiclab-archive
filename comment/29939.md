For my group's poster, we focused on the earthâ€™s biodiversity and the number of species that currently exist, as well as how many are facing extinction. The focus is the importance of these species and the benefits that they bring to our environment as a whole. These species provide us with so many resources that allow us to live our basic day-to-day lives, and once they go extinct, they're never coming back so it's imperative that we preserve them.  

 

Our bottles represented some off the most common plastic pollution found throughout our oceans. Plastic bottles, labels, fibers, Styrofoam, and much more.
