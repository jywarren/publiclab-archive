Hallo  khufkens 

I checked the histogram of both float and they are not the same. PhotoMonitoringPlugin float image misses allot of information.

To be clear my application generated the same NDVI color picture based on my float as PhotoMonitoringPlugin. 
It is the PhotoMonitoringPlugin which does not create the correct float image in my opinion.
