Our neighbor has the plant camera above, which he uses to take time lapse photos throughout the growing season. This camera is outdoors year-round in Wisconsin. Perhaps people, like me, without good coding skills will be interested in this type of camera.

Entering "plant cam" into Amazon had some hits, ranging from $90 used to several hundred dollars.
