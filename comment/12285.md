When I first started thinking about this a couple years ago I figured auto-detecting the calibration targets would be key but that turned out to be a stumbling block since I couldn't decide the "best" way to do it. I'll probably let someone else deal with that aspect but once someone decides on a good way to do it adding the feature recognition code should be too difficult as long as a reasonable protocol was followed to help the algorithm succeed with the detection. The current manual method only take a few seconds so it's less cumbersome than I originally thought it would be.
