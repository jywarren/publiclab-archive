Whoa... no, a bit tough to use. If you can describe it as a sequence of colors, the format I mentioned will interpolate gradients between them. Just looking at yours, it seems like it could be:

0: white

0.167: black

0.33: white

0.5: black

0.55: blue

0.7: yellow

0.9: red

1.0: magenta

what do you think?
