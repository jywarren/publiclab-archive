Hi there, I'm currently trying to use this image as part of a tutorial in QGIS and can't seem to get the link to work? there doesn't seem to be a .jpg image associated with the link any more? I get the following message:

"This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it." 

Any help getting the image would be much appreciated, thanks!
