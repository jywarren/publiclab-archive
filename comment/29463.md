Thanks [@bhamster](/profile/bhamster) for the mention. 

After two years push notifications still work for me. Received more than 8k of them saving countless time by non constantly checking the map. 

Also [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) contacted a developer some time ago. They may have an improved version available by now.
