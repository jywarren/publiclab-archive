TedF, could you upload a photo of the camera held to the picavet with its elastic bands?

I've just tried to make a version of your Picavet using pulleys.  I found that the smallest available pulleys in my local chandler's were too large.  (See attached.)  As these pulleys are also more expensive than eye-bolts, I'm going to revert to the simpler technology now.
