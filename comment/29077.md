Yes, those spikes are aeration.  Later I dropped the DO sensor and used ORP to control the aeration cycles.  Nutrient removal is always a game of diminishing returns, but because much of the effective treatment is anoxic, I think I was often using less power than was typical to reach even better removal rates.  I really want to continue the research, hopefully I will be able to soon.  I can definitely talk to current standards and enforcement in Louisiana, and the challenges that wastewater plant owners and operators face.
