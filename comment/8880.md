Okay, BOOM:  https://github.com/Pioneer-Valley-Open-Science/mini-meter

- Nice picture, here: https://github.com/Pioneer-Valley-Open-Science/mini-meter/blob/master/mini-meter-osh-front.png
- Based on the 32u4, so works like a Leonardo
- Minimalist -- just the pins, ma'am. No buzzer, no leds.
- PCBs are $5.70 for 3 on OSHPark
- Additional electronics are probably around $6 or $7, in batches of 100
- Total cost of parts per board in batches of 100 -- about $9.
