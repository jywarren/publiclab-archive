[@gautami_gg](/profile/gautami_gg) and [@lekhidugtal](/profile/lekhidugtal), this has been expanded upon and refined a bit with the Style Guide, and we may need to update these designs a bit. But fundamentally the Style Guide incorporates, refines upon, and "generalizes" a lot of the work that went into this work. So these largely still stand, but the Style Guide is an attempt to make a more holistic guidance document from this that can be applied to other pages as well!
