That's great. I might suggest tests in Jest, as many of our libraries are starting to use it and it's a bit easier to work with than Jasmine! Though I'm not sure about Mocha as much myself; i know there are some tests on our site using Teaspoon/Mocha (on plots2) but we also have Rails System tests in /test/system/ which test JavaScript.

Thanks!!!
