Hi  peppepegasus - 

I don't have a package for the Mac at this point since I don't have a Mac. You can try to follow these instructions from a previous note: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy
If you are able to get it to work and can create a package for Mac can you please let me know so I can post it on my GitHub site. Thanks - Ned
