Thanks Chris,

I appreciate the encouragement. I just checked and the A495 was in Program mode. I was using it with rubber band over shutter in continuous mode before. I just took a half dozen photos that look normal. I'll have to look at the CHDK settings and see if I can share them to troubleshoot it, unless I can sort it out.
