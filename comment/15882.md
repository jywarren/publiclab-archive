Hi and thanks for the reply.  $300 is way out of my budget. I only need to "see" into a pine box with walls only about 1/2 inch thick.  The bee cluster is less than a foot from the walls on the inside. I also would like to incorporate a Raspberry PI (or clone) for data capture and storage.  Would you happen to have any suggestions for a DIY solution? Anything would be helpful at this point.  
Best regards,
rob
