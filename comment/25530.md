We shared this on Public Lab's social media. The Facebook post received this reply: 
_Is there already a community of folks interested in collecting data? Also, schools are, generally speaking, really into technology. It is fairly common for a school to have a maker space. They take many forms. Maybe reach out to a local school/ district to introduce project and offer the opportunity to build the sensors?_
