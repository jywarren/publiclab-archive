 [@B-winters](/profile/B-winters) That is exactly what I want to achieve with that as well. Seeing as taking pictures with the mobile paper spectrometer and then later adding it to the spectralworkbench also does not work because pictures are always inserted in the wrong configuration and you cant rotate the pictures.
