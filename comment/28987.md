Hi, great project! I have a question, not exactly related to the raspberry pi microscope but I'm hoping you'd be able to help me out... I'm using a web camera with the similar flipped lens concept to build a microscope but the image has a huge amount of background noise... looks like the components of the chip are somehow projecting their reflection onto the image. Any suggestions?
