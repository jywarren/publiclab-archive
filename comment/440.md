Thanks for fixing that. [BTW: might want to add .tgz to the allowed extensions too]

The scale on my in-progress build has wavenumber, frequency, wavelength and electron volts.  _Just because it can_ :-)  I personally only use nanometers, but chemists and physicists have an annoying way of wanting the others, so the handy conversion reference is right there in the photo.
