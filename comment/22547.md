Not quite at the point of plotting data from loggers, but generic favorite for this type of data is R. Pluses: free, extensive libraries, well tested and recognized, and, did I mention, it's free. Within R there are a number ways to plot data from vanilla data plotting within R to add-on libraries like ggplot. Negatives: The down side is that the learning curve can be exhausting.
