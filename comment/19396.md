Can someone ([@kinasmith](/profile/kinasmith) ?) do a quick screen recording with CoolTerm open while talking about what menus  and settings are needed to actually make a connection through a serial port? Also, what is a serial port? When I open CoolTerm, the window says "bluetooth-incoming-port 9600 8 n 1" .  On my computer, I have a USB port, and HDMI port, an audio jack port, and that proprietary thunderbolt mac port. What cable can i use to what port? *** thank you ***
