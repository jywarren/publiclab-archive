Here in the lake Erie area, we are suffering from algae blooms.   You can look up the problem.  But especially in the western basin of lake Erie, the algae growth has discolored the water and caused problems with drinking water. 

This is blamed on phosphorus run off from fertilizers used in farming. Phosphorus is needed in fertilizers.  But if it isn't absorbed by the soil and just runs off into the water, is it doing any good?  The temporary answer, at least, has been to fertilize earlier in the year, when it is not raining.  Your farm agent should be able to tell you more.  But I think this is a temporary fix.
