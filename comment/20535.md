[@jiteovien](/profile/jiteovien)   It seems there are three versions, two for outdoors and one for indoors? 
Does the indoor one also require Wifi?It seems the outdoos one do.I may not have Wifi connection in on of the areas. From the description, it reads that the indoor version only uses one sensor as opposed to the top-end one which uses two. I wonder if there is big difference in terms of accuracy. 

Thank you!
