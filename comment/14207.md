If your spectrometer uses a webcam, you can use a webcam program that does interval shooting or timelapse. I tried a couple of these a few years ago and made timelapse videos of things:

I'm not sure if the free programs I used are the best choices now, but you can find current options by searching for webcam timelapse, or webcam intervalometer, or phrases like that.
