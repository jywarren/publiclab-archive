Very interesting post! NDVI is correlated with chlorophyll pigments, correct? Different phytoplankton types have different concentrations of chlorophyll so NDVI could potentially be used to differentiate between types of phytoplankton. That could be used to inventory species in a specific body of water or it could potentially be used as an assessment of water health. There are certain species responsible for algal blooms (including toxic blooms) and if you could get a measure of their concentration in a sample you could monitor the growth over time leading up to an algal bloom. I’m not sure if any of this is feasible, but it’s an idea.
