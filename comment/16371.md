This is really great - and I love those cheap little Arduino Nanos. Do you have a list of part costs and a total cost? I'm curious if people wanted to do a minimal sensor package based on this but with only some of the sensors, and what that'd cost people.

I've been using these headers on Nanos which allow plugging into a tiny breadboard, as well as using jumper wires to make assembly easier:

This gets bulky but is nice because people don't need to solder as much -- but it depends on the kinds of connections you're trying to make. I'm always thinking about how a circuit setup could be done such that someone (like you or the kits initiative) could just re-bag parts and ship them without soldering, or someone could just get all the parts listed and not have to solder. 

Not that soldering is the end of the world but it is a barrier. 

Great post, Chris!
