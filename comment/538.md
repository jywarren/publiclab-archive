OK, awesome - this page lists the voltages needed to trigger the shutter per-camera-model, but does not list the A495: http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CameraFeatures

But 5.5v USB power from an Arduino did work. I'm curious if I can draw 5.5v or something like it from elsewhere on the camera... maybe from the power plug or the A/V port? or from the USB port itself? Hmmm.
