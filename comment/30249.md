I'd recommend starting off with high efficiency appliances. There will be Energy Star, "Most Efficient" status ([like on this refrigerator](https://appliance.report/refrigerator/2393302/) I was researching) and other markings that mean long term energy savings. This will be more beneficial over the long term than trying to cycle the appliance on/off or something like that.
