I am new to this field, and am busy trying to mod a Mobius by removing the IR filter and adding a blue (red remove) filter.  I have made a side by side mount, to allow to Mobii to take the same image.

Will the two images allow more processing?  It seems that by working with the six channels there is more potential....

Also, if there are two cameras, is it necessary to add a filter? (after removing the IR filter).  Could useful results be obtained by subtracting the filtered RBG channels from the unfirltered?
