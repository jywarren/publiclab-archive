[@warren](/profile/warren), regarding the cable type: there are two [different standards](http://forums.windowscentral.com/windows-phone-8-how-guides/249287-note-headset-standards-omtp-ahj-apple.html). The main difference is that ground and microphone signal pins are switched. Besides this, many manufacturers implement own protocols or standards for volume/mute buttons and so on. One can not clearly say Apple is using AHJ and Android is using OMTP. For Android it also depends on the manufacturer and production date.

The SoftModem Arduino shield has a switch with a lable saying "Samsung" and "Apple". But what it really does is switching between the AHJ and the OMTP pin assignment. Interestingly the library was able to decode the signal no matter what position the switch was set. I think this behaviour is very beneficial for our purpose :)
