I have been trying to figure out a way of measuring the volume of an "open" model that I generated in Meshlab so reading this post was very helpful. I'm a biologist and this technique would be super useful with my current project. 

However, it would be great if you could please explain how you "used Blender capabilities to “close” the bottom of the earth mound feature" as this is the part I have been struggling the most with? Thank you in advance :)
