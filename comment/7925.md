Hi, Nathan - yes, Chrome doesn't have a camera selection interface yet, and I've filed a bug report with the Chromium team. Firefox for Android does, and works really well. I believe Opera does too. 

We'd like to keep interface parity, so while we are working on native apps, we are hoping to keep the HTML interface, and basically just create JavaScript methods for more advanced camera access and manipulation. 

Thanks for the feedback!!
