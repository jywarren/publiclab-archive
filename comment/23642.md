Just relying quickly as its late in Newfoundland. Thanks for your response! It would be great if the limitations of the device and what is still unknown could be listed up front and very clear language was used on the store page to describe what applications this device was good for like "Try using this kit for educational and experimental use, but please try a more expensive and validated sensor like x if you are trying to understand your air quality." I think [@mimiss](/profile/mimiss) 's example, with a modified handout, is a great one! The examples that you link to now of speculative uses doesn't make that clear to me. In my experience, intuitive color coding (from green is good to red is dead) can make people even more freaked out than quantitative readouts that have little meaning for them. 

Are there questions that PL is specifically hoping to answer w/ this kit? I see these questions https://publiclab.org/questions/OrionAllgaier/03-13-2019/questions-from-the-university-of-wisconsin-eau-claire but they don't seem like they would be answerable through building this or similar kits.
