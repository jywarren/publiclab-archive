The clean water act is a federal law passed in the United States giving them the power of governing water pollution. The clean water act was passed in 1972 to protect our health. For example, Camp Lejeune for years they knew about the toxics but did nothing to stop it. The marines and their families that stayed on the base of Camp Lejeune suffered from the conditions of the water. They also had a lot of carcinogenic chemicals.
