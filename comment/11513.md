One of the great pleasures of working with Public Lab has been introducing my students (who do not identify as scientists - in fact, the opposite) to sensors and mapping. I particularly enjoy their various expressions of surprise when their Coqu√≠ sensor works to test water conductivity. These range from "WHOA" to "OH" to "EEK" to "HAH".
