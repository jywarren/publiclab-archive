This is very interesting!  I was doing some research on adapting my own IR camera a few months ago, and came across a few sites that prescribed using a certain film, exposing it to a certain type of light for a certain amount of time.  It would be interesting to do some experimenting here, exposing film to different types of light for various times and using a spectrometer (IR filter removed from the webcam) to test how the resulting filter behaves.  It would be necessary to also control the development of the film, this would probably mean taking it to a place where you can request all the film to be developed at the same time or under identical conditions.

This sounds like a fun experiment, I'll probably do this if I find the free time before someone else does ;)
