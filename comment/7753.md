Hi cfastie, thanks for your answer. I know it sounds crazy but I am planning to use the balloon close to the ground at around 10mt high at the beginning. If everything goes ok I can increment the high and keep testing. 
I've been using my smartphone paired with my camera and it's really basic but it works but I am not sure what is the coverage range of the WiFi. Do you know what's the max distance I can control my camera with my phone from? I know that if I stick to ten meters it's going to be ok (perhaps) but what about 50mt?
Thanks
Marcelo
