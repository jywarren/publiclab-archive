There was also a question about later work on lead testing in soil, by [@MelissaN](/profile/MelissaN) - I think it's highly speculative but here's an interesting article on LIBS, or laser induced breakdown spectroscopy: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0584854707000079

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIBS

A starting point, at least. The lead spectrum shown in the article is in the visible region, but I don't know if we could get a laser strong enough to actually induce this kind of spectrum.
