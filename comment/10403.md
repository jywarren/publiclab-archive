[@warren](/profile/warren) You aren't taking integrals, you're accumulating y-values.

This might be equivalent if and only if the difference between x-value samples are equal. So like, if your sample interval along x-axis is always 50 Hz (50, 100, 150, 200) ... then your implementation is fine.

If the sampling interval is ever a little off (50, 110, 130, 156 Hz), then your algorithm will not yield good values.
