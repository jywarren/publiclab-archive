Thanks Chris. We're away to Denver to celebrate my brother's birthday. I'll try to check with the SX260HS (supposedly 4.5mm (W) - 90.0 mm (T) (35mm film equivalent: 25-500mm), then try the other modes, either by toggling through or editing the sketch to making one with more rotations the default. Have you had others report trouble viewing your Photosynths in Firefox? Is there another place I can look to see your results?
