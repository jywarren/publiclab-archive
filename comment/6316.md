Hi, Peter - great suggestions -- our main limitation is that we're short on programmers; are you interested in implementing any of this [using the API](/wiki/spectral-workbench-api)?

This one in particular would be great -- do you have a best-practice way to identify such peaks, i.e. a code example?
