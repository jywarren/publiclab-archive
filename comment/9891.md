Just to be clear, I'm not suggesting in any way that anybody fly in restricted military areas.  Quite to the contrary, I think airspace restrictions around military sites would be perfectly reasonable. Rather, I'm surprised they haven't been clearer about their policy. Especially when a few careless fliers could prompt the entire National Park Service to [impose a ban](http://home.nps.gov/news/release.htm?id=1601) on all NPS lands.
