There are apparently some misconceptions here.  As I read it, the monitor used by Apte was a commercial DustTrak not a dustduino and his research had nothing to do with a dustduino. He's doing graduate and decently funded research. And the monitor was placed within his vehicle which makes sense because he was concerned with the exposure of someone in a vehicle using the roadways. This was not a test of a mobile dustduino.
