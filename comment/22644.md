I dont know if this answers your question but I think it answers some of it . Years ago NASA did a study on plant absorbtion and filtration and they broke it down to each plant and how much they could accept and take out of the air and soil. I hope this link helps you[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Clean_Air_Study)
