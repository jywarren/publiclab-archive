I do have some documents and quotes for smaller pumps, though they're more costly (roughly $100 with shipping included) and when [LukeS](/profile/LukeS) tested similar pumps they got mixed results. These were mostly to save shipping weight/size for the formaldehyde test kit, as the aquarium pump is a little bulky. 

It looks like there's some more research on this [here](http://lukeskaff.com/diy-formaldehyde-testing). If you can find a cheap 3 diaphragm miniature DC pump, that may work as well as the aquarium pump.
