I'm using an SJCam 4000, it's a cheap GoPro clone. It doesn't have custom white balance settings so I'm using incandescent with a red filter. I'm also using a Phantom 3 to fly mapping missions with the SJCam mounted on the landing legs.

I recently wrote an ImageJ macro to subtract the blue NIR channel from the red channel before running the NDVI processing. It seems to give clearer images with better separation between color values. I think a big problem with these action cameras is the red channel also receives a lot of NIR.
