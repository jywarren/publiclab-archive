Chris,
I think I may have "solved" one of our issues - sharing 3D point clouds and 3D ortho-models online. If you can generate a 3D PDF from MeshLab using U3D as described here:
http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/
then you can embed the results easily as seen here:
http://flightriot.com/interactive-3d-model-hosted-at-flight-riot/
I'm very excited about this!!!
