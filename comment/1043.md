Several things are exciting here, Jeff.  It's great that the Atlanta Reef Club is using our tool!  I am heading down there in August for an EPA conference, so I'll shoot them an e-mail.

As for the green laser fluorescence, I'm reading a little bit on lasers, but get a tad confused.  It's green, so it must be emitting in the green spectrum there, but is its energy confined to the visible green wavelengths?
