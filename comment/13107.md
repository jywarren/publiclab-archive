Cool.

I'm thinking having the camera with stock lens, and camera with 6mm lens. Then offering the range of lenses as individual items for people who feel like running a conversion themselves.

Might be worth a color correction script, a la the one we install on the infragrams before shipping.

anyone remember who wrote that config file?
thanks for all the feedback!
