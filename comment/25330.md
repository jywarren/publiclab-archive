Hi [@stevie](/profile/stevie), [@Aleah](/profile/Aleah), [@Cbarnes9](/profile/Cbarnes9), and [@crispinpierce](/profile/crispinpierce),  
stevie's list is excellent, but perhaps more detailed than is necessary.  Please correct me if I am mistaken about what the UWEC group is doing, but the Purple Air allows its data to be downloaded:
 http://www.purpleair.com/sensorlist, 
and this can be opened with EXCEL.  I have found that data cleaning (which can mean different things to different people and depend on the analysis software one wants to use)  is relatively simple within EXCEL. However, many of the functions that one might need are not commonly described. If Aleah can post about 20 rows of data and describe the cleaning she is doing by hand, I might be able to help out. I have found no problem with manipulating this downloaded data in EXCEL and importing into R for analysis and graphing.
