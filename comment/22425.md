Many older cities treat stormwater before it is discharged. Quoting Kate Asher in Anatomy of a City (2005), _"New York is one of only 800 or so cities in the [United States] that rely on what's known as a "combined sewer system"â€”one that mixes storm water with wastewater, and sends them both on to the same treatment plant."_ Page 174.

Combined sewer systems have "combined sewer outfalls" -- i.e., the ends of pipes that discharge treated water into waterways. These outfalls are well documented, have publicly visible signage and each have a permit. During times of high volumes of rain when treatment plants can't handle it all, "combined sewer overflow" (CSO) events release untreated stormwater AND untreated sewage directly into waterways.
