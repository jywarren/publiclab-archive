Other feedback I've received from the geospatial community includes:

"I think GeoDa (http://geodacenter.github.io) is friendlier than QGIS if you need an open-source alternative."

"gvSIG (http://www.gvsig.com/en) would be my other choice but only if no other option. I would rather make an inventory of required tools in QGIS to be accessible and make a custom profile, I believe the toolbars can be hidden/shown with some customization."
