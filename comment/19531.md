Oh wow, that seems like a really interesting possibility. I wonder if there's some potential for folks that want to send up loggers to measure atmospheric conditions at different altitudes? Or maybe some people could use something like this to disperse seeds? It's a great question! Have you explored any applications for kite messengers, or have ideas you're thinking about trying out?
