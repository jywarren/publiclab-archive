There are two devices I'm familiar with which could be relevant to your question:

Nima - uses detection strips for gluten https://nimasensor.com/
SCIO - can measure the concentration of fat and other ingredients in foods. But just for high contents, not ppm/ppb. https://www.consumerphysics.com/
