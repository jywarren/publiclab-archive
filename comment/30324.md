Yes, that did it!  Thank you very much.  Only did a quick once over of the diagrams. It looks like they take the focusing lenses out of a CD drive and attach it ( via a popsicle stick) to a phone camera.  That is then put over the slide which is over the light source.  Got some more head scratching to do to figure it all out.  Thank you again.
