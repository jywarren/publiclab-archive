[@Rayishido](/profile/Rayishido) -the high NDVI values is a normal occurrence with shadows. You will notice that the NDVI values will change in the shadows depending on how light or dark the shadow is. I understand there is a method for correcting some of this in pre-processing however I have not attempted it myself. For me it is just an indicator that the area does not contain accurate values. If you can, try to take images at a different time of day when the shadows are not noticeable.
