No jeff, ask as many questions as you like, there should be a lot more discussion and interaction between all of us here. I'm not using NaOH3, which is sodium bi-carbonate (baking soda,) for the oil samples, I am using 0.1M of NaOH, which is sodium hydroxide ( a very strong base, hence the high Ph.) these are called "buffer" solutions. 

The sodium hydroxide was mixed with the ethanol for the oil samples, the baking soda for the fluorescein. 

ok, aromatic hydrocarbons, which are organic compounds, have unique chemical properties, you can either cause a reaction by heating and what is called fractional distillation (difficult and needs expensive equipment,) or by a catalyst, hence a chemical reaction. Using different chemical solvents, you can separate the single and double carbon and hydrogen bonds of the molecules, it's like a recipe, here are a couple of good links explaining a lot of this process if your interested:
