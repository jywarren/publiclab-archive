Hi, I am trying to download high resolution PI camera V1.3  images but Pi Builder locks up or produces files with no data.   Is there a setting for high resolution picture settings ? My settings are attached.   Not interested in video just trying to get 2592 x 1944 pictures for microscope observations. Thank You
