Ahh.  I see what you mean about the date the images were taken being different from the date the map was made.

I think that for the time being, it will be best to stick with the format you described above (I already have more than enough on my plate) - but I think that nice-looking map titles should go on the list of long-term nice-to-have features for MapKnitter.

Making these nice-looking map titles work in the long-run won't just involve a format change.  In order for MapKnitter to be useful, this change will need to come along with a transition to a "supermap" default viewing mode, as well as a built-in interface for searching maps by location and time, as we've discussed in my "[Interface Refactoring](http://publiclab.org/notes/justinmanley/08-06-2014/mapknitter-annotations-interface-refactoring)" research note.

Re: visible / infrared imagery - yes, I'll add a checkbox.
