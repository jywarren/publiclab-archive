Hi, there! we're actually working in a open trail cam using initially raspberry pi an motion detection. I was swimming a little through the net and found the "orange pi" that actually has a microphone integrated. I'll give it a try as soon as it's in stock again. I'll try this one: Orange Pi PC plus</br>

As soon as we get some results we'll back here ;)
