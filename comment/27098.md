The emission bands would be best seen at night.  And they are flame condition dependent.  So you would want to monitor the flame some way.

The best way to monitor would be in dead air.  The blowing wind would mess things up.

Sulfur and TENORM, now your getting into the experimental phase.  The flame temp should be measurable from a distance.  The rest of it..  It will take some work to say the least.
