Confirm?  Hmmm... well, I have two data points, both of which coincidently use the same multiplier on EC to get TDS. From discussions with folks who are a bit more knowledgeable than me, the value of the multiplier is a major point of contention. It really depends on what the 'solids' are (eg. organics versus salts) and what you mean by 'dissolved'.
