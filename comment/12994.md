Cool!
I super support the easy AA battery option. I have a design for a DIY battery case I can mock up soon, one that will ship flat. I'll watch to see what terminals you go with.

My only other feature is the self-test script for manufacturing, when they install firmware so it blinks "hello" if it works.
