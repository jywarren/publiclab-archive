[@warren](/profile/warren) it seems to me lately that PL is actually a three part project: 
1) developing research tools that are low cost, modifiable, and easy to use, 
2) actually using these tools to do research in particular places, and 
3) using the data and knowledge that are created as a result of doing research to advocate for environmental health justice to policymakers, press, courts.
