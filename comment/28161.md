The window is the correct size it is used to select a pixel row from the camera. I have the Thunder Optics SMA-E model and works well with SW also mine came with the Spectrogryph, a full feature,fully functional software which is available free on limited  trial. but is another BIG learning curve. Contact tech support with tyour ser# and they will send the docs for yours. They include a calibration file (how to) which uses a CFL light source similar to SW procedure. My Label are  Thunder cam1 or Thunder SPec1
