Hi Mathew,  My guess it that this is going to be a processing issue.  My next guess is that there is a problem on line 13 of the Dropdown_Lists tab.  The line says:
     comList = serialPort.list();
try changing that to the following and see if that fixes things:
     comList = Serial.list();
I think the serialPort.list() comes from controlP5 but Serial.list() comes with Processing.  Either command works with windows, but I dont have a mac here to try  it on.

Let me know if this works.  If it doesn't, I will look some more.
Jack
