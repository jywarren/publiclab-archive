Very cool to hear about your installation in Connecticut! Hello from New Jersey and NYC :)
i usually hear about pelican cases being used. 
If the RPis will be out of reach from humans, sometimes an upside-down bucket / canister is all that's required to shelter it from rain. But if these are visible to humans, count on them being poked at (or more) by curious folks.
