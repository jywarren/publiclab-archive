Yeah I got those numbers off the TRI page if you go to the main TRI page (http://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program), search the zip code: 39567 and click on mississippi phosphates it will give you the numbers for that company specifically. 

The 12 cease and desist orders weren't all for this company, it was -- in total the DEQ had given out 12 CADs to companies since 2009, four of which have gone to MS Phosphates.   Any suggestions?
