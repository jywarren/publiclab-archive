That orange color of the leaves is promising. It should be even oranger. If you can put the plant in brighter outdoor light and take two photos -- one with awb_gains and one without, or try different parameters, then we can compare to see if it is working.

Some experiments with other cameras (not Pi cameras) suggests that cameras with CMOS sensors instead of CCD sensors work better as NDVI cameras if red filters are used instead of blue filters. It will be good to see results from a Pi cam, which is CMOS.
