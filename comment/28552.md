Regarding power tags vs. regular tags, there is some incomplete work on restyling going on here: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8684

And, I like the direction you're thinking on how to display tag trees, but I also think this would need some more time and thought and input from community members as it might add some considerable complexity to some parts of the site. 

I definitely appreciate your illustration of a category tree, and I love the icons!!! Perhaps there's a way to link from a tag page to the category tree interface on another page? But we can workshop these ideas. I appreciate your thinking deeply on them. Thanks!
