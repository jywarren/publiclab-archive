Hi, very cool! Would you be willing to open source your patch by sharing it in this note? I love Max/MSP and also Pure Data/PD!

If it's easier, there is already a live video version of Infragram at Infragram.org -- you can connect directly to the webcam and run NRG, NDVI, etc etc in the browser. Does that help?
