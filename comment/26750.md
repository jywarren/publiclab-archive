Hi [@Sam14](/profile/Sam14), Image Sequencer has experimental support for processing gifs: https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer#experimental-gif-processing-support

You could try this out by converting part of your video into a gif, and then running it through. Note that after processing, each frame will last for one second, regardless of what the frame rate was before processing.
