Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), Thanks for the reminder to add pictures. I have tried inserting photos a few times today, but it keeps crashing the edit (and, seemingly, causes me to be logged out. weird). I'll add photos in comments. Would you try inserting them into the body of the activity and see if it will work for you?
