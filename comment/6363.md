The idea of you, in the canoe becoming a GCP is a really neat idea Chris. We can see you in those high elevation images. So after the images are stitched together we can use that data. What must be hard though is the time stamp and the GPS coordinate time stamp. So we've learned that syncing the clocks on the camera and GPS unit at the beginning is really important, huh? Were the RGB and Infrared camera clocks and picture snaps time synchronized to one another?
