Haha, well, the power's in your hands here, Justin, as nobody else is likely to be coding on MapKnitter :-) -- I've definitely not had time in the past year or two to do much. 

Clutter could become an issue, but i like your solution for it, and in some ways we can afford to solve that problem later. What's the opposite of re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic? Making seat arrangements on the first interstellar starship? I.e. things we can reasonably expect to complete soon all sound good to me, honestly, and we'll figure out the rest when we're closer to having time to implement it. 

I like your JSON version history, that's how I'd do it too...

I like your nomenclature of "map" and "patch" -- does "export" still work?
