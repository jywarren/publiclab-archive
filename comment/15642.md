I've tried uploading *blink and a few other things, but it looks like nothing is uploading. The riffle still appears to be running the previous sketch: the D1 LED is blinking every 20 seconds, taking an RTC temperature reading. I'm not sure what steps to take to troubleshoot this, other than
* Swap out the USB cord
* Turn everything off and back on again
