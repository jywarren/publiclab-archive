I went ahead and created a specific issue for native 8-bit storage: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/issues/18

As well as outlined the exact lines that'd need to be modified, including the tests (which currently use scaled data).

Besides rejiggering the tests, the legacy data issue is a big one, but we could let people "turn this on" optionally for legacy data, and make it the default for future data.
