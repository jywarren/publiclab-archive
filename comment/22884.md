Look to http://sage.thesharps.us/ who emphasizes to people who install Codes of Conduct not to forget about the actual enforcement part once something goes wrong. Just the posting alone is no silver bullet. 
Also Claudina Sarahe https://twitter.com/itsmisscs of http://compositescollective.com/ can speak to this.
