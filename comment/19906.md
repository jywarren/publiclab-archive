Hmm! Interesting point. I didn't think about the flashing LEDs! But thinking about this, it should be possible to put some black tape on the LED. I'll try it. Talking about Chromium+VNC there's nothing special about it. It's just starting VNC server and then instaling an launching Chromium browser. The main issue is speed. It takes type to start the browser and it's not comfortable to work with. I'll try if I can access via Raspberry Pi via HomeKit/Wifi from my Macbook. It should be possible.
