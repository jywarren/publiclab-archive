Hello [@warren](/profile/warren)
I have asked for this issue as a first time contribution, and may be give a patch for it by today itself.
And for the other thing I saw that proposal by [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal), and I think it will be great to merge this two proposals into one and make a useful API. But I haven't heard of team-up in GSoC proposal. Is it possible that we two can gave one proposal as a team?

Just a doubt.
