The second part of your question:

-Do not conduct ambient air tests next to gas/propane tanks or you may get a false positive.

-Do not test near eucalyptus trees (especially on hot days).

-Avoid testing near fragrant vegetation, such as roses.

-Avoid testing near compost piles and trash cans.
