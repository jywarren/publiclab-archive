thanks to [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) for the interesting charts... How did you take it ? 

Looking at chart, using just the blue channel as NIR  the NIR/VIS sensitivity is about 0 at 750nm this will cut NDVI in this range due to camera sensitivity.

But using a Wratten 25A filter and the blue+green channels as NIR the green band might compensate the lack of signal in the range 730-800nm and reduce the effect of NIR light that "leaks" in the red band. Is there any test for this ?

Finally I think it depends a lot from camera sensitivity without the IR filter.
