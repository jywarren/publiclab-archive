Hi, I reposted this from https://publiclab.org/wiki/coqui-a-simple-water-conductivity-sensor -- to make it into an activity that can be featured in the Coqui activities listing: https://publiclab.org/wiki/coqui#Activities -- to help [@kgradow](/profile/kgradow) run a class based on this.

I hope I got it right -- if it should be authored by [@kanarinka](/profile/kanarinka) and co-authored by [@ashkaya](/profile/ashkaya), please tell me and I can switch it. Thank you -- it's a WONDERFULLY documented activity!
