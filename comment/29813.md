The ones from Fisher Scientific and Thermo have notably better quality seals than no-name brand tubes. So if you are putting them somewhere swampy it's worth the effort to get them instead. Even then for deployments past a couple of feet I'd still look at how we build our PVC housings - those things spend years down at 20-30m depth without issue.
