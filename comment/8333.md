David,  
Did you see this [note about the potential to indicate the presence of cyanobacteria](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-27-2013/cryptogams) using the difference between NDVI made with infrablue and super-red filters? It might make it possible to confirm that certain types of cyanobacteria are present.  
Chris
