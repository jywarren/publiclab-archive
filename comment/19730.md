During the leptos development we bought this board. We'are now playing with a point and shoot NDVI with raspi. I'll give the "IVMECH" board a chance again and try two raspberry pi cameras V2  ;) It would be possible to get a visible light image together with a near infrared one. 

Image sequencer is amazing!
