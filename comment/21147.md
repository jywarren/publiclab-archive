Good question [@warren](/profile/warren). I think in terms of how it looks, v3 and v4 are similar, but v4 is obviously more powerful. Biggest changes are flexbox and better custom font support, easier spacing, 5-tier grid system in v4 (but no glyphicons). 

It will take some time to get it all sorted, but it will also be an opportunity to drop pages that aren't needed.
