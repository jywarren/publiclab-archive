OK, update - since the B sensor was covered yesterday, it's now showed as "downgraded" just as the A was yesterday:

[![Screen_Shot_2019-05-10_at_11.44.55_AM.png](/i/31869)](/i/31869?s=o)

My question now, is apart from blocking, what if I put a filter over one sensor so it (presumably) reads lower but not "nothing"? 

In [this comment](https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/04-18-2019/what-are-the-advantages-to-using-2-particle-sensors-at-the-same-time#c24056) above, we saw it report "4" despite that being the Sensor A reading, and I'd blocked Sensor A. It didn't look to be averaging, but we should double-check. 

But if we're right about this, does it always show the lower number of the two? Let's see once I put a filter over just one of the two sensors to artificially depress its readings.
