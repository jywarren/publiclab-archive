Pat, I think the pointcloud will have to be closed into maniform mesh, and then possibly constructed into a solid.  [Here is a tutorial on using meshlab to close a point cloud into a mesh](http://arc-team-open-research.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-to-make-3d-scan-with-pictures-and.html), so that it can be opened in Blender.
