It may be that the video processing in the different camera chips handle movement differently .. thus the apparent delay and re-synch
Is there a steady function on one camera, which will try and smooth out movement with auto cropping of a frame larger than the recorded image?
Does one of the lenses have an anti shake feature? Also if the lens barrels are moved / shook in relation to their sensors.
Good work though, It sure beats building a 200 foot tripod.
