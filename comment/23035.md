You might like some of the work that [North Brooklyn Boat Club](http://northbrooklynboatclub.org/) has been doing in their [Ed Shed](http://northbrooklynboatclub.org/education/). They also have a nice [workbook](http://northbrooklynboatclub.org/assets/EDShed_booklet2014.pdf) designed for kids that might be a good model for developing other kinds of site-specific curriculum.
