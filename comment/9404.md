When I created the images above I scaled the output so and NDVI or DVI values less than 0 were set to 0. To include the full range of possible values I could have used -1 to 1 for NDVI and -1 to 1 for DVI but for the most part I'm not interested in the negative values. 

The advantage of reducing (in my case by half) the range of values is that it lets me see finer changes in NDVI or DVI values.
