looks great and usefull. I made a very, very dangerous and poor quality spot welder in high school by chaining the capacitors found in disposable cameras in parallel up to a single disposable camera charge circuit, and then adding a higher current power supply than a single AA cell. worked great for 20 gauge wire and smaller. it eventually melted its circuit board. It also nearly stopped the hearts of me and several friends in accidental discharges.
