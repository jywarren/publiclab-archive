Would you like to make this part of a series for your SoC work? You could add a tag to any related work like `series:_________` with some unique tagname of your choice, maybe `series:raspberry-pi-imaging` or `series:raspberry-pi-imaging-soc` and then there'll be an overall listing of these collected. Try it!
