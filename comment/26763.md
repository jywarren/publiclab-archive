Also re [#mapknitter](/tag/mapknitter) , when I try the new cloud export function i get a teeny tiny unreadable image in both tif and jpg formats, and this is true no matter what resolution I choose, from 25 to 110 cm/pixel. Why is this occurring and what can I do to fix it?
I am working on the map 2020_bean_bed, the central three knit maps only. Thx
