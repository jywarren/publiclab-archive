I like "tag to this procedure" - would it have a power tag like `procedure:13431` ? We have to have procedure_ids as well as instance ids, since people will "run the procedure" multiple times. When you open a procedure, i assume it'd pick up at the last unfinished step?

Once the capture happens, if it has a `procedure` tag,  it'd redirect you back to the procedure?
