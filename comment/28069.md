hey Purl!  contact me at scott@healthygulf.org

we are interested in monitoring

heat index in New Orleans "Climate Priority" Neighborhoods
Particulate Matter in New Orleans

if you live in an Orleans Parish "Climate Priority" Neighborhood, I would like to work with you on getting you a weather station or a Particulate Matter monitor, does that sound like something you'd like to do?
