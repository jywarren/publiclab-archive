[@pazb](/profile/pazb) I'm also interested in introducing a community to the balloons for aerial photography. In planning my workshop I believe I will ask my people to form groups and let them determine what they think they would like to learn about the area we will be flying over. I'm interested in stormwater run-off, but there are so many other uses. I recently learned that India is using satellite imagery to spot kilns where they make bricks, because these are areas where child/slave labor is happening. So, there are many things that can be learned with eyes in the sky. I hope you will post another research note to let others know what data your community finds helpful.
