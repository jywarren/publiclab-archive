Yeah, the webcam itself gives a good image and is focused. Moving the diffraction grating from 60 degrees to 45 degrees on top of the webcam gave this (no noticeable difference?)

The enclosure blocks all other light, so that's not the problem. I can't make a baffle with the ceiling light, but I thought the collimation slit was meant to block light from other angles anyway?
