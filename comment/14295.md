Actually, you need several additional pieces for SWB: 1) average 3-5 parallel lines, 2) monitor stability and take data until it IS stable or times out with an error and 3) time-average the 3-5line pixel data, and 4) monitor the non-band dark field and subtract the average as residual DC offset of ambient light.
