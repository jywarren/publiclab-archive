Hello again. 
I just did two quick screen captures explaining how to do this with CoolTerm, using code from this [GIST](https://gist.github.com/kinasmith/fd46b7c17b332520d0fb56f863e3ed15). 
The First one is here: https://goo.gl/t3fAwP
The Second one is here: https://goo.gl/eMyzgX

Let me know if there are permissions issues with the videos. They're hosted on Dropbox right now. Also let me know if none of this make sense and I'll try to do better.
