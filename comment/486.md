Mathew, mounting cameras base to base is a good idea (but then 
the USB ports are on opposites sides).  Eventually 
the payload will include a few AAA batteries and some USB cables.  Maybe they 
can be placed to balance the load. But I agree that matched cameras will 
solve most of the problem.
