Hi, [@bkleist](/profile/bkleist)-
One thought regarding the moisture obscured lens-if the camera is in an enclosure, a small fan to circulate air should help with condensation. There are little battery powered fans, though I don't know about battery life, especially when it's cold outside.
A computer fan may be more efficient and reliable than something from a box store; one from a laptop that's not working could be free, plus easy to mount.
