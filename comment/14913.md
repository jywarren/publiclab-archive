Thanks for the input Chris!

The reason I have been using wooden dowels is for their wide availability (can be consistently found at any craft, hardware, or home improvement store). 

I agree that a pin through the shaft provides a simple and reliable locking solution, although my goal is to find a solution that can be incorporated without the use of tools.
