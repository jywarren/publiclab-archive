Hi ggallant. Sounds interesting. I'm trying to picture your design, but I'm not sure if I have it right. Can you post a picture?

I definitely think a cap in the feedback loop is a good idea, and probably a cap on the power line as well. I'm still thinking about the best way to design the amplifier board to minimize power consumption and allow for a wide range of turbidity measurements.
