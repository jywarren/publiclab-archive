Maybe -- the paper describes different kinds of filtering, one from when the laser enters the liquid, one from when the fluorescence exits the liquid. Seems like we can minimize them with geometry (whee!) by scanning close to the edge of the sample jar, and keeping the laser close to the leading surface of the jar. 

[@natalie](/profile/natalie) -- this is definitely a vote for smaller sample containers, though. If we could get 1 cubic  centimeter or less, that'd be great, and for shipping costs too!
