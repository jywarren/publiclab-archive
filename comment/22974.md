I love GoPro, and I am following up to the question as I do want to know for some alternatives to it for aerial mapping. I have already been reading a lot about GoPro. Recently I come accross about Fish eye effect, and that is a great feature of it. Though someone mentions about [removing Fisheye effect from GoPro using Photoshop](https://www.techtricksworld.com/remove-fisheye-from-gopro/), I want to know how can we do it in the gopro itself?
