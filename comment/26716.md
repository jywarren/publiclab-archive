Regarding using it not live, you can save an image by pressing the blue "save" button. This creates a new post on spectral workbench and is a place to comment and edit the image. Saved images create [posts that look like this](https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/176743). You can also fork (duplicate) another person's image and analyze it as well. 

You are also able to upload images of spectra from the homepage. To upload, you'll open the drop down menu next to "Capture Spectra" on the homepage top right.
