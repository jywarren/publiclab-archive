[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) This is a very informative article. However, It isn't clear what is to be done after obtaining the final graph as you've shown. Are we going to change pixel values of the image to match the slope of the line we've obtained in the graph or the graph is only for our reference to have an idea of the spectral reflectance by different pixels in the image? Pardon me if this is a silly question but I am not clear about this.
