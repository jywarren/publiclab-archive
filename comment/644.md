Hi, Chris - there's a [short video on converting a camera](http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/near-infrared-camera), which shows this material, but basically we're buying color film, completely exposing it by pulling it out of its case, winding it back up, and getting negatives made. The resulting dark material can be cut up and used as an infrared filter.
