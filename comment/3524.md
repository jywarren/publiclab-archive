wow, cool -- i guess all mercury, huh? i suppose there aren't *that* many things that glow as bright as mercury, and if it gives you R, G and B, tinting the glass is a totally reasonable way to get colors. I do wonder if you can only get "cooler" colors since the mercury lines are so narrow. I don't mean bluer colors, but am thinking of the difference between a doped CFL and a basic mercury tube.
