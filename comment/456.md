Hi, Ron - I wanted to applaud your willingness to come back to the site/list and enumerate some of what you found out. Plus I was wondering what kind of measurements of primary production you're looking for -- i.e. could NDVI be used for high-res studies along these lines?

I don't think flying balloons near windmills is a great idea :-0 but i do wonder if NDVI regularly collected from a low-flying aircraft could be used to establish/measure production? Are you talking about productivity of algae, mainly?
