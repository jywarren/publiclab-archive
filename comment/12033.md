Yeah I started some assembly, using the Redstone we have and some of the photos you posted as reference. The leg brackets were surprisingly easier than I expected.

Please send over measurements for the S100, I already drilled a hole, but I put it in the wrong side, not realizing the mount is asymmetrical.
