Hello,

A few questions if I may...

1) In your "make sure you have the camera parts shown below" photo, several pieces of read tape are shown.  What kind of tape is this, 2-way?, masking?, electrical?

2) What is the purpose of the tape in 1) above?  To keep the camera board isolated in some way from the raspberry pi board?

3) It is still unclear to me from the pics what should be done with the tape that has been put around the lens to keep it dust free.  From the photos, it appears that the tape is NOT removed when putting the cover on the camera.  What needs to happen for this step?

Once I get past these points, I can move onto worrying about whether I have the pi board connected correctly to the camera etc. 

Thanks in advance,

Darren
