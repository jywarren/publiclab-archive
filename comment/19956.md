I recently received this kit and got really good performance out of it. Our camera inclined at possibly even more of an angle than I interpret from the photo above. We had trouble positioning it initially and ended up taping it to the block with black PVC tape. I also cut a groove in the block for the wire. You may find you need a lot light to get a spectrum - hold it close to a CFL bulb - pointing straight up at one can be handy.
