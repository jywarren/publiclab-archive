I agree that this material is more appropriate for a wiki than a note, but I wanted people to see it.

Such a wiki should be built by somebody at PhotosynQ who actually understands this stuff, and the wiki should live at PhotosynQ where lots of people will be looking for information on how and why the MultispeQ works.
