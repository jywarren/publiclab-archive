There are definitely advantages to server-side programs. But we've found that making lightweight, clearly documented mini-libraries for different purposes can really make for good maintainable code, and after all, we don't really want PublicLab.org's codebase to start growing to encompass all possible uses. We've felt it's better to think of it as the platform and each of these libraries as a kind of "app" running on it. Does that make sense?
