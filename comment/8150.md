How do you swap channels in an unmodified camera from RGB to NIR? What kind of camera are you using?
I am really interested in this, I am photographing forest with different IR filters with a normal (unmodified) and an altered (de-filtered) camera, two cameras same model, at the same time. Trying to determine NDVI and NBR.
Any input to determine which wavelength and color I have in each channel will be useful.
Thanks!
