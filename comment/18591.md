It's very useful.  Thank you for the information.

Atomic emission is good, but for maximum sensitivity, you need variations.  These are atomic absorption, which requires an extra lamp specific to each element, or something like inductively coupled plasma ( icp).  ICP takes a lot of extra equipment. The cost for ICP is probably very high.
