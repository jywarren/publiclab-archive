Ah okie thanks! this is all waaaaay over my head. thanks for the clarification re:professional sensor outputs. I think the precision is higher than that and I don't want to take any unnecessary risks.  I asked the PI of the project if she has any data loggers we can use.  it would be great if PL offered the 16 bit ADC option. I emailed the company this thread and will see what they say about precision.
