Hi, Will -- sorry for the slow response, a lot happened (not least the Barnraising). 

Yes, there IS an onramp for first time code contributors! We're actually in the midst of a big program in that direction. You can read a bit here:

https://publiclab.org/tag/software-outreach

A bunch of these entry points are available here: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/labels/first-timers-only and I'd be happy to work with you! 

If you're alternatively or also interested in joining in another capacity, we need more than coders: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/11-08-2016/help-public-lab-s-software-grow-by-joining-a-supportive-team

I'm so glad you asked!
