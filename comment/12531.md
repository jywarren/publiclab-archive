I am not sure what your question is. You could use the two-camera feature of the plugin but give it the same Wratten 25 photo for both the VIS and NIR photos. Tell it to use the appropriate channel from each photo, and I assume the plugin would give the same result as if you used the single camera feature and gave it the same photo and chose the appropriate channels.
