There's been some progress on reading live data from a sensor using audio -- see https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-08-2018/visualize-live-sensor-data-with-p5js-and-an-arduino and other [#webjack](/tag/webjack) work -- 

...and of course if you're using a data logger, you can read it off using an SD card reader -- see [#14521](/n/14521)
