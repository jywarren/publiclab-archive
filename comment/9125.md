That's true - projective distortion cannot be achieved with an affine transformation. 

The existing Cartagen/MapKnitter 1.0 code is just a wrapper around some existing code (using that matrix class) which I convinced someone to open source (the guy you found, Bryan). You can probably just clip that code out of Cartagen and hook it up to a Leaflet 4-sided poly.

Here I call "update()": https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/blob/master/public/cartagen/src/warper/image.js#L109

This sets up the polygon and starts the recursive "divide" code: https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/blob/master/public/cartagen/src/warper/image.js#L344

The "divide" function: https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/blob/master/public/cartagen/src/warper/image.js#L399

Actually drawing the image for the subdivided patch: https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/blob/master/public/cartagen/src/warper/image.js#L514
