I take it the idea is to get the red/blue flashing really fast, making a gradient red-->magenta--->blue depending on the resistance of the thermistor in the 555 control circuit?

I like this a lot. Thermistors are non-linear in their response, so tuning this to different temperature ranges is going to require some thinking, but its a really excellent idea.
