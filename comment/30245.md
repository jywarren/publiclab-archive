Great ideas! I'll add a percentage column to the table to better highlight how much of the month was over 12 Î¼g/m3.

Highlighting community reports is a good idea as well. Other than the main report during the 5-day period, we haven't received many direct observations unfortunately. 

This is a good opportunity to remind the community to reach out to us with any observations of odors and visible plumes! You can make a post here on Public Lab, or add your observation to a public Google Sheets document! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DaxaIkxFRXYdwnYdnBoi2pKhaZnEYg6U8eUGQCSXsv8/edit?usp=sharing
