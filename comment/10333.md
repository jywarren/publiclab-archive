Yes! And before, when we had a different relationship between freq and conductivity, the only way to do that tuning was to tweak the probe -- and Jeff W had a great idea re: e.g. placing probes on a ruler, and tweaking.  But now, we can just add a potentiometer to the circuit, and tune the frequency output of a standard saline solution (contact lens / Perrier / etc) to match -- done.  Woohoo!
