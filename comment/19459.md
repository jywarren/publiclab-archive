Hi [@partsandcrafts](/profile/partsandcrafts) [@bmela](/profile/bmela) [@wmacfarl](/profile/wmacfarl) [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) - I broke out the "install on an SD card" steps into a separate activity:

https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-20-2018/prepare-an-sd-card-for-a-raspberry-pi-camera-from-scratch

That made it possible to simplify this one a lot. What do you think?
