Nice! I love the water bag tests, it is really brilliant. What is the cost of the bags? If doing a large scale deployment, it seems like it would be pretty low-cost to run this quantifying control at the same time as the field experiment, with the same strips, ect. I can't wait to see the results! Thanks for posting the link on the analysis as well. I have used the histogram analysis method in Photoshop to quantify color intensity in aerial images and found it works somewhat, but the accuracy is not that great especially when you have really similar tones. However, I have only used the data to demonstrate total percentages of land use/cover/ect. I am definitely going to see if graphing the numbers makes a difference in the accuracy/understanding of the data. It seems like a simple program could be written to do this automatically too! Fantastic, thank you:]
