Also, if you merge your branch in and give people an alternate "beta" interface, we can compare them directly, by using

/maps/foo (current version)
and 
/map/beta/foo (yours)

and indicate such options in the interface. As scattered as the current version is, we don't want to replace it without being sure we replicate all its features and debug, and having both running simultaneously is a great way to ease into the switch.
