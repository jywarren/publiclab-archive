Hi [@Katie](/profile/Katie), i believe we have done something related, but not exactly what you are inquiring about. We have used video interviews to learn how people search for / navigate to environmental information on publiclab.org. We did user research to understand what our information architecture was lacking (hint - a lot ;). 

Most of our tool design and tool documentation was directed by in-person requests, tests, and feedback.
