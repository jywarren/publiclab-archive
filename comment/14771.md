I am also very curious how much temperature affects the batteries in very low current applications. I haven't found good documentation about that. If a device is pulling less than 100µA, or in some of my applications, less than 10µA would the cold be better? Isn't the self-discharge rate of the battery more than that? 
You can get temp from the RTC with these two functions:

```
rtc.convertTemperature();
```

and then

```
temp = rtc.getTemperature();
```

getTemperature() returns degrees C as a float.
