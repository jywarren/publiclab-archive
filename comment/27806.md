Absolutely [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1)
Should we include this fantstic assembling guide?
https://publiclab.org/notes/kgradow1/11-08-2020/how-to-build-a-bucket-air-monitor
Also amazed with the "Hear Smell Feel" part of the log here https://publiclab.org/notes/kgradow1/10-21-2020/how-to-keep-a-pollution-log
We'll begin translating the assembling post. How should we attribute it?
Let's rock!
