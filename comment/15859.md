Thank you [@sarasage](/profile/sarasage)!  I'm going to check out both of these sites.  What I'm looking for, though, is a button that's mechanical instead of electrical (something that requires no batteries, etc).  Ironically, I want *less* advanced technology haha.  It's something that I could probably figure out how to make on my own if I can't find it anywhere else.
