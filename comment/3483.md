Ok, so I've got my "hand held" going. Now, I am using distilled water to get my media baseline. Is there a highly effective method and light source to get good readings through aqueous solutions?

Right now, I've gotten an extreme of my H2O baseline(over the brightness 100%) and really dim solution with a halogen light source. Not having the H2O baseline would not give a comparable to filter differences right. So I am trying to get it first. My system is custom(droid razor)and does not produce crisp color with spaced differentials.
