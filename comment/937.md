I'd love to brainstorm and offer suggestions -- but I am much more likely to do so if it's on this website, since then it's all open source. In general I'm not good at one-to-one correspondence, 'cause compared to putting it up on the PLOTS site it's kind of a bottleneck to open collaboration. I hope you understand.

If you post some of your ideas I'll definitely participate in comments etc!
