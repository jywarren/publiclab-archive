Hi [@Jordansalcido](/profile/Jordansalcido)! Thanks so much for sharing about this issue with urban heat. The Data Driven Envirolab is doing some neat things with heat island data, tree cover data, and other social and environmental indicators in different cities. They've got some info on Los Angeles here: https://datadrivenlab.org/urban/cities/los-angeles/. And more of a narrative including comments from residents in this post about Montreal: http://datadrivenlab.org/the-urban-heat-island-effect-in-montreal/. Maybe some ideas here or a potential connection?
