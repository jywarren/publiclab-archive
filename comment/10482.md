Talking about density, temperature, and floating makes me think of a Galileo thermometer: they are sealed with little glass beads that show the temperature.

You might be able to capture some of the water from the injection site, seal it in some kind of neutrally bouyant bob, and drop that bob in the water. You'll probably never see the bob again and thus pollute the river with objects. I'm not really sure this particular density concept goes anywhere helpful now that I've written it.
