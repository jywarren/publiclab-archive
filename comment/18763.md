In this area (Ohio), at least, trace levels of hypochlorite  ( bleach) work their way into the storm sewer.  If you have a piece of red pH paper, bleach acts like it would on red shirts.  It turns it pink. That causes an error in the pH reading.  We would double check with a pH meter when something seemed wrong and eventually traced it to hypochlorite.  It didn't take much ppm.
The new pH paper might be better than what I used.  So please see how your results track now.
