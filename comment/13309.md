[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie), I'm trying to do the white balancing manually using a Raspberry Pi and I need to know the number of this "pure blue" that you are using. After pointing the camera to a piece of paper with this blue, I want to obtain a grey image (the same as you did with a Canon Camera), I'd like to know the number of this grey too. Does anyone know it?
