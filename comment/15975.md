Well, the compensation is based on the sensitivity of the semiconductor, mostly (i believe). I think you could try to block the wavelengths that are over-represented, but it might be hard to find a filter that was the exact inverse to the sensitivity of the camera. It's a pretty interesting idea, in theory, though. 

But do you mean overexposure in general? That may be a separate question -- just an excess of brightness overall, not inconsistent response on a per-color basis.
