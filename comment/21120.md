[@amychan331](/profile/amychan331), nice proposal!

Have you thought about any implementation steps like the mockups, controller implementation, etc? If yes, please add them. Also, please mention about the testing - Testing each part in that week or Testing after 1st milestone or After the completion of all parts, etc. Thanks!
