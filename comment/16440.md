Thanks Warren. These past few days I was exploring the `inline-markdown-editor`. Its approach is clean and understandable. So yes I think implementing the wiki's `commenting` and `suggesting` features like that is good. As now I'm confident with current implementation codes of `wiki` and with `inline-markdown-editor` codes, in coming days I'm willing to work on some previous issues regarding wiki. That should help me understand more and contribute.

As for pros and cons you asked, I see much of pros. Because implementing these features as `inline-markdown-editor` is good for future use. Because we have a separate module in case of any new comer to understand how it is implemented.

Thank you very much again
