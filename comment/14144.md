Dear [@bha](/profile/bha), thank you for showing us how practical this MQ-135 sensor is.

Alas, none of the images on this research note are showing up today.

As a quick work around, could you edit the "http://24.media.tumblr.com/" at the beginning of every image link, and change it so they start with "http://60.media.tumblr.com/"?
That tweak seems to make the images show up better today.
(Is there a better long-term solution?)
