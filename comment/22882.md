The rules for flying drones are different from the rules for flying kites or balloons. The rule that flying is prohibited within five miles of an airport applies to drones and balloons and kites, except that special permission has generally been granted to fly kites or balloons near airports. To get the permission, you must request that a notice to airmen (NOTAM) be filed. There is [more detail here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping-regulations). I don't know if that information is up to date.
