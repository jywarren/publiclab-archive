 [@warren](/profile/warren) I have completed the prerequisites mentioned in the post.
I would like to be a mentor with Publiclab for RGSoC 2019.
A little about me:
I am a full stack developer and have been contributing to opensource projects from past 2.5 years. I started my opensource journey by contributing to Zulip for about an year. I have also contributed to Hasura as an intern and currently I am contributing to Fossasia. I am a GitHub Campus Expert and have organised numerous events including workshops and sessions for freshman students of my institute. I also organised and mentored in an event called [OpenCode](https://opencodeiiita.github.io/) ([OpenCode GitHub](https://github.com/opencodeiiita)) which is a month long event to bring more people into the world of opensource by mentoring and guiding them in resolving issues over GitHub.
My GitHub Profile: [Anupam-dagar](https://github.com/Anupam-dagar)

Looking forward to your reply.
Thanks ðŸ˜ƒ
