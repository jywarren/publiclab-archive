That's a really cool-looking wind sensor. The new one requires at least 8 volts, so a big battery pack is needed. It would be pretty fun to put that on a KAP rig. I guess it can handle 10 to 20 mph wind. They don't say how much wind the old version can handle, but it seems to be aimed at breath and indoor air currents. The old version can run on 5 volts so it is easier to add to typical Arduino loggers. Adding one of those to the SkyPod could be sort of awesome (and the SkyPod flew yesterday for the first time which was awesome enough to merit a gin and tonic afterwards).
