Week-eleven update: I am putting together a list of useful literature to include in my literature review. I have found interesting and informative pieces regarding Far UV-C light and the incorporation of it in LED form. I also received a tour of the 3D printers on campus and learned new ways to ensure the material I am printing is antimicrobial (aside from using 'antimicrobial' filament). Nozzles used by the printers are made out of different materials. I learned that stainless steel and copper nozzles do not harbor bacteria and, therefore, play a big role in their reduction during the printing process.
