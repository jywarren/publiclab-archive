Thanks [@stoft](/profile/stoft) and [@warren](/profile/warren). I've left the DVD as it was in spectrometer v2.0 (test: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/91439) and it works.

Now I wonder to which distance should I adjust the focus of the old camera in the v3.0 kit (I saw your comments https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/05-03-2013/spectrometer-focus#c4612).
