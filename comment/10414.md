Thanks for your response.. I did manage it to work it like you describe. my only problem is that I want to use the "NDVIblue2red.lut" which is in the folder from github. In the readme file it says that I have to copy the lut file into the lut-folder of fiji. but exactly that folder I'm unable to localize on my mac..
