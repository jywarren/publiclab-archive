Caleb Hall- 3/25/2022 Native vs. Indigenous
Native refers to something specific while indigenous is broader. Say an animal is born in a desert, you can say that animal is native to the desert because they have been there since birth. But indigenous would refer to an entire species of something. For example, say a plant is naturally found in a certain area, that plant is indigenous because it naturally occurs in that area.
