I am in touch with someone who lives in Standing Rock who used to work for the EPA and left because of corruption.  She's talking about getting a jet ski to do mapping of water around the reservation next spring.  I am looking to try getting the potentiometer and the spectrometer working and would like to talk to people about metals.  I am also looking at mapping uranium runoff in Pine Ridge around the power plant that Georgia Power is planning to build here in Georgia.  I am thinking about connect with labs at Emory or the CDC that have worked with Flint and other metals contamination sites.  I'll try to meet about the weekly call in hour to talk more to you about it.
