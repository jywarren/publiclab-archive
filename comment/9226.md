From the literature on stickypads, concentrations of particles smaller than the resolution of the scanned image can be roughly estimated by albedo changes in the pad. PM2.5 indicates the median aerodynamic diameter of the particle.  My contention would be that being able to see 75% of the PM2.5 range and measure albedo changes for the remaining area ought to provide some useful information. 

Whether this can ultimately be correlated to volumetric standards, however, is an open question. I'm getting more skeptical about accomplishing that.
