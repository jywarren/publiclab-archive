Okay i got your point . I checked the API's we have and currently we do not have any API that fetches people who have commented/posted (will confirm with [@warren](/profile/warren) as well) . 

I guess this API will help in statistical analysis which is also our project for Outreachy intern . 

[@warren](/profile/warren)...What do you think ?
