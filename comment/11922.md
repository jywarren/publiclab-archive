Hi, I'm currently trying to create a potentiostat that will be able to do similar electrochemical experiments. Mainly, I would like to do corrosion analysis on gold electrodes in a saline solution. Normally, I use a large, commercial potentiostat to run electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization resistance tests to see how the electrode impedance changes over time. Do you think the latest iteration of the WheeStat would be able to run these tests after some modifications with the microcontroller code and GUI? Thanks.
