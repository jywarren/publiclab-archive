In case others are interested in the answer to this question:

The histograms of the infrablue photos are screen captures from Photoshop pasted onto a capture of the image in Photoshop with a marquee displayed. The histogram is just for the selected area in the marquee. Histograms have a few display options.
The other histograms are screen captures from Fiji. With an image displayed, click Analyze/Histogram. Click "Live" and drag the cursor to select an area of the image. Click "RGB" to toggle through the colors (it won't show them all at once). If the displayed image is floating point, an initial  dialog allows scaling the axes, but these scales don't apply to a "live" histogram of a marquee. Click Contol+ to enlarge the histogram window.
