Hey! Thank you so much for writing such a well structured and informative post. I am very excited to become a part of the community. however the link to join the public chat is not working for me. every time I open that link I'm getting a "website can't be reached" error. can you please look into it if the link is correct? thank you. update: the error seems to be with the link. the correct link is https//publiclab.org/chat and not https//publiclab/chat as mentioned in the article above üëç
