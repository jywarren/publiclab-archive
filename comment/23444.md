 Hi Anthonia, I think you can improve the readability of the timeline but if the Outreachy application contains more organized timeline, then it's fine.

Also, you haven't mentioned any First-timer issues, we encourage applicants to break some part of their work as FTO issues too, to include newcomers in their project. 

Thanks!
