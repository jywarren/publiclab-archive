[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) - Thanks for getting back to us! To clarify: a vertical (outflow facing upwards) or horizontal (outflow facing toward the root ball) are both ideal setups? Any thought about the hose coming from the bottom of the planter, pointing upwards right next to the root ball or under a light layer of larger medium?

Any experimentation on integration of a squrrel cage fan (ala the Plant Air Purifier) versus the aqua-vaccuum-and-hose setup?

Best,
Aaron
