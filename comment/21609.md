It looks like you're connected to a logitech webcam that isn't set up for spectroscopy-- if you're plugged in to a spectrometer via usb, you may simply have connected to the wrong USB camera (check your options-- you might need to try plugging in to a different usb port if it's not showing up). Which spectrometer are you using?
