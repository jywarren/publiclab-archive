There might be an argument for some file-based format which may be easier generated instead of relying solely on git. Public Lab's current Rails code would require a major overhaul assuming Rails even has the right plugins (gems) to ease the process. Node.js might make rendering these things simple as dirt from a git repo, but we need some way to export the notes out of the current Public Lab database/website. This is where a simple document format might shine.
