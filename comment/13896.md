dhafnersr,

That hasn't helped me one bit.

Does lol mean "lots of love" in email language.

Goodness knows what Ïµlc means.

The only bit that is meaningful is A=log(10)

An equation without a description of what is in the equation is meaningless, unless of course it's an equation that everyone knows like E=mc2. Sorry! there's no way I can put the 2 as a superscript in this reply system.
