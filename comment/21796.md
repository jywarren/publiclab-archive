[I posted a note here,](https://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/12-28-2015/some-gulf-coast-use-cases-for-the-oil-testing-kit-in-2015) let's see if i can find test results. [here photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/healthygulf/sets/72157643774962275), there was oil pipe cleaning sludge, along with biogenic oils.  the chemical smell of oil was very strong <1 ft from the water surface.  

Production waste is briny, and will sink!  

keep in mind, after 20 minutes of exposure getting the samples out of this ditch, i was in minor respiratory distress from chemical exposure.  i took the next day off to sleep it off.   not for kids.
