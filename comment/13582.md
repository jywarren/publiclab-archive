I've looked at those vented set screws-- their vent holes are tiny but they might work. 

I'd like to try sealing one with glue.  My suspicion is that its going to be hard to get enough glue in to get a good seal, and that the glue will fill the hex and make removal hard. At a buck a piece its hard to complain and definitely worth a shot.
