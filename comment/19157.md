Ran across this article that discusses at a high level the relationship between salinity, TDS, and conductivity. [Reference](https://www.instrumentchoice.com.au/_literature_173380/The_difference_between_conductivity,_TDS_and_salinity) . It specifically mentions the conversion factor of 0.49 for EC -> TDS when measuring salinity and 0.91 for  sodium bicarbonate in solution.
