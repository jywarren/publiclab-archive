Useful thing to measure at a distance: Flame-offs at refineries and factories. Try to see what they're burning off! If it's at night, it could be illegal and they're just hoping no regulators (or DIY scientists with distance spectrometers) are watching. And the burn itself might give good emission lines...

This is SUPER exciting!
