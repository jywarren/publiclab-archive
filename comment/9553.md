Thanks for all the positive feedback! I'm not sure where the bags originally came from, but they cost about $35 for five here: http://beprepared.com/basic-25-gallon-boxed-water-kit.html
The concern I have with the technique is whether jostling the strips around freely within the bags will smear off their coating and affect their discoloration, but I'll find out in a week and post an update!
