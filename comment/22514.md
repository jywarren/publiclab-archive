Hi [@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and power of hydrogen (pH) measure different chemical properties: ORP provides information about electron transfer reactions, while pH provides information about hydrogen ion concentrations. The usefulness of each of these analytes depends on the question you're asking. If you simply want to know the stream's acidity, then pH is easier and more straightforward. If you want to gain information about what metals species may be present and what range of metals concentrations may be possible, then you'll want to use a combination of ORP and pH.
