[@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) Thanks for your review!
 I have scheduled testing after each month, but I will change my timeline and include testing after every implementation. 
Also, I will open FTOs and help the new comers to get started on the codebase. 
In the meantime,  I will look into how to take user feedbacks.
