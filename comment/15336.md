I saw your related request on the LEAFFEST organizing thread, just wanted to connect that info here as well: 

```
- how the cams could be set up (angle, location, hight etc.)
- what types of pollution could be captured by the camera
- if the camera could also capture information like water depth? 
- what type of camera would be most useful for this? if any special housing or mounting is needed? 

Here are a couple threads throwing around this idea.
