[@jwarren](/profile/jwarren) ,Thanks for the feedback. I would like to submit my proposal again .Please guide me on which domain I need to focus. As you mentioned in the comment that there is need to comments ,suggestions and notification in the existing research notes. But currently we are able to write the suggestions and comments to the existing research notes .Also , due you want notification as we have on facebook for our comments on the article.
We are not having any meetup section with the registration form nor any suggestion or help page,i guess, can we create it?
So , please explain me a little more so that I can again work on my proposal and resubmit it.
Thanks, [@jwarren](/profile/jwarren)
