I wonder how much motion it would get on a simple flight without jostling it at all. This is such a great idea, allowing for chaotic energy to get you a desired effect!

I wonder if you could get good information on the rig's behavior from the GPS data on a long flight with short intervals?

Great innovation on this. I'm immediately wondering how to make an analog without the printed parts, such as using a church key on a canning lid, etc. to get similar shape into flat pieces...
Very cool Chris!
