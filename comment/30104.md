Hi [@takurofisayo](/profile/takurofisayo) and thanks for posting
The mock-up image is not fully visible. You could maybe separate it into multiple images for each page and add them on the proposal itself. I also noticed you do not have the milestones/timeline schedule and also the explanation on how you plan to tackle the project. As deadline is near, please do finish these sections so we can give better feedback. 
- not a big deal:  I noticed you also used _italics_ in places where you maybe didn't mean to, you could check that too.
Thanks
