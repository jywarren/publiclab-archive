Boo, television chroma key suppliers... i really do suspect they just sell blue paper as "chroma key" because they sell it in big enough rolls. I have doubts now that there's anything "special" about the chroma key paper. In the future, we should look for some non-fading paper/ink/paint, maybe paint sample cards or something.

in the meantime, yeah; everyone should keep their blue paper under wraps.
