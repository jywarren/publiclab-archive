Ok, interesting idea. The extension to this is a continuously variable attenuator and let the detection algorithm pick the line w/max signal but w/o clipping. When the phase grating is off a bit from orthogonal, the line of pixels is actually viewing non-uniform light exposure just due to the inaccuracies of the slit. However, maybe given all the contributions of smaller errors, a continuously graded attenuation, with center zero, over the length of the slit might work. Of course, the user would need to hold the device steady during capture.
