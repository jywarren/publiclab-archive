After much experimentation, I finally came up with a simple dithering method that allows you to easily use oversampling to add 4-5 extra bits of resolution to the humble 10-bit ADC on the 328p (aka Arduino) processors:

[Enhancing ADC resolution with Dithering & Oversampling](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/2017/02/27/enhancing-arduinos-adc-resolution-by-dithering-oversampling/)

My primary use for this will be reading thermistors at resolutions better than 0.01Â°C. The technique would work with any resistive sensor, though you might need to tweak the pin currents a bit from one board to the next.

Cheers!
