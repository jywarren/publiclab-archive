Hi Chris - [OSHWA](http://oshwa.org/) is organizing an October-long "documentation month" where different groups host 3h group hardware documentation sessions. We were wondering if we could do one at LEAFFEST -- maybe in relation to the [new Activity Grids](/wiki/spectrometry#Activities). Even though it's not in Oct, it's close enough and OSHWA is amenable. What do you think?
