 MaggPi very interesting project.  Was there a link for status/instructions?  I also noticed David Prutchi of Hacketeria had an interesting multi-band polarizing imager, probably we could reach out to him. I have been researching a portable microscopic imager and spectrophotometer.  I also thought about how your project could benefit from several VOC/CO2 sensors or light sensors to inform research goals.

Thanks for sharing!
