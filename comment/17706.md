Hi [@gretchen](/profile/gretchen) , do you have any more comments specifically on the interrelatedness of tags? That's what we are discussing here, rather than the adjacent navigation question of "primary landing pages always at the top." Here in this thread, we are working on developing how to -- for the first time -- show clusters of interrelated tags on Public Lab. I would love to hear any thoughts you have on clustering.
