The colour ranges of retinal cones are:
Blue-Yellow
Red-Green
Light-Dark

In photography:
The subtractive colour spectrum (start by calibrating White-balance) gives red, green, blue.
The additive colour spectrum (start by calibrating Black-balance) gives cyan, yellow, magenta.

This is what it looks like when missing with overlapping filters:

This is how software helps you adjust those balances in RGB & CYM:

I hope this helps you find a spectrum of relevance to you. :)
