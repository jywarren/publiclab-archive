It looks like you're using Spectral Workbench in live mode. On the lower left hand side there is the option to apply an existing calibration. You'll need to capture a spectra to create and save a new calibration to apply live in the future. That dropdown menu will also allow you to apply some calibrations saved by others.

You can learn more about the calibration process here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-calibration

This video also has a quick overview of calibrating captured spectra:
