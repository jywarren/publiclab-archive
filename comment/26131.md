I just looked into these a little further. All of them use sulphuric acid which can be dangerous. 

The brown ring test: https://byjus.com/chemistry/brown-ring-test/ 

The diphenylamine test: This is a colorimeter test; if by adding adding diphenylamine, ammonia and sulphuric acid  to the water, the solution turns blue, then nitrates are present.
