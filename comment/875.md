Hi Guys, have you checked out the Research Note we posted a few days ago about our open source project Rhus?  http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/deepwinter/6-5-2012/rhus-open-source-mobile-gis-community-ecology

You can also read a little more about it here

I think we can extend this system very easily to add the kinds of GIS points that you are discussing here, and all the mobile to web integration is already completed.   I'd be interested in others perspectives on if this could be a component of a useful system for PLOTS annotations.
