Very cool! I want to be sure [@sophie](/profile/sophie), [@ewilder](/profile/ewilder), [@Clarke_Brian](/profile/Clarke_Brian), [@deepwinter](/profile/deepwinter), [@megan](/profile/megan), and [@fernandolunav](/profile/fernandolunav) see this and you all can coordinate on different h2s approaches and calibration. I know Sophie was doing a test series in a hood, for example.
