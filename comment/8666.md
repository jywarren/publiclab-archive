(original comment seems gone...) ...I commented that I did try a pattern but that the auto-focus for the default camera appeared to focus momentarily and then drift off. I also commented that Google Chrome Beta is available and seems to run but that the camera selection for S4 android is still broken.

Edit: Yes, 'broken' only means that the code difference between Chrome and SWB should remain on the list and that using Chrome Beta did not, by itself, fix the issue. I'd thought it possible that the selection feature was there in the app an it was just that Chrome was ignoring the request.
