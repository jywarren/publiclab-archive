I think support for reporting bugs by both users and devs would be nice!

As to the mapping, that's right. And specifically these more complex inline features like maps and grids, we've extended markdown by creating a mapping back and forth between a short code like `[map:____]` (for example) and the interactive HTML map. Does that make sense?
