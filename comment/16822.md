Hey!
This is the GitHub link : https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/23
I sincerely apologise for the delay caused, and will make sure it doesn't happen again.
Actually I was maintaining a Wiki on GitHub as I progressed : https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/wiki/Development I was about to convert the same into an issue soon.
