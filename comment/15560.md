[@warren](/profile/warren), I posted some draft note on testing to: https://publiclab.org/questions/stoft/09-15-2016/what-mechanical-specs-can-and-should-plab-spectrometers-meet?_=1475287316  .  Also, I don't know if you wanted to include my paper-n-tape (shall I say retrograde-upgrade) here but it's at: https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/09-22-2016/all-paper-n-tape-mock-up-of-plab-3-spectrometer . It just might provide some interesting additional data for the testing.
