[@stoft](/profile/stoft), Hey dave, it might make a difference that their excitation wavelength was 470nm and mine was 532nm. That's why i am doing this again but with spekwin's hardware control, I can adjust for intensity and wavelength, I couldn't use it before because it only showed the Y axis, until Dr. Menges updated it, now it should work fine.

here are the two sample spectra separated on different graphs so the plab sample isn't crunched up on the same plot:

 Also I cross sectioned a bigger part of the red shift of the fluorescent spectrum when I captured the sample, so that "tail" and it's "lump" could very well be that red shifted wavelength.
