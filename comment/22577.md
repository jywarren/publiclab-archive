Hi [@Mempet](/profile/Mempet), in my experience, submerged filters (and any equipment that is submerged) generally needs to be manually cleaned rather than using any sort of biocide in-situ. Would it be possible for people to remove their filters, and then scrub them to remove the algae manually? What material is in the filter?
