[@RonHuber](/profile/RonHuber) chimed in on the lists:

> We hypothesized the calcium carbonate dust emanating from the Cement Kiln Dust waste piles of a cement kiln near Penobscot Bay had a local mitigating effect on surface water acidity. We got them to cover their dust mounds in 2005; there seem to be reduced abundance of coralline algae in nearby Rockland harbor's  and Rockport Harbor's rocky intertidal and shallow subtidal for the last  decade


> Connection? Maybe. It would be insightful if calciferous species within the windshadow or dust dispersal zone of cement kilns near other shores were compared -  Ocean acidification is known to affect skeleton formation of coralline algae.
