cfastie, xvidun, and myself had a little talk about interfaces.  I'm going to go the opposite of Jeff's minimalist suggestion here and suggest that we stick with a file management pallette.
the idea is to have a place to:
manage image order
choose between automatic image order or manual image order
choose between auto placement or manual placement
highlight images by name (click on name, highlight image, click on image, highlight name.)
upload in the background
manage images for annotations
