The laser cut slits are good, but the kerf of the commercial laser cutters we've used is about .2-.3mm, and depending on the material there can be some roughness to the edge from the evaporation/condensation/burning of material.  The photoprinting, while introducing an acetate layer that could change the transmissivity, is far, far cleaner and can produce extremely small features with the utmost of accuracy.
