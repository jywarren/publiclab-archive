Ben, thank you for that explanation, it is very helpful in understanding many of the challenges and solutions presented by conductivity field measurements. Looks like I want to get a few more opamps to try some of these circuits. I wonder if some of the noise others have seen in their conductivity measurements has come from the ground acting under load...

Thanks!
