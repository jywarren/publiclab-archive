[@mimiss](/profile/mimiss) thank you. I am using 2 filters, one is a UV band-pass filter that is made of glass that works at about 380nm, so near-UV, the other is a true UV Quartz-window based filter that I was able to obtain using a custom order from a filter company, Kolari Vision in New Jersey USA, for use with my multi-spectral converted DJI Mavic Pro 2 Hasselblad camera.

I will of course share the code on my GitHub page and will add a link to this page in a message form and will let you know shortly. I am also working on some new NIR image and Video segmentation code that I will hopefully make an article about next week.
