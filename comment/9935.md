Yes I should have documented my work a bit better.  I basically followed the tutorial and then kept moving the zoom around and playing with the settings.  The image was the latest from the Landsat set.  Here's my hypothesis...the water is much shallower in that area, yet still submerge and there is a channel that has been created in the soft sand.  Water passing through that channel then cools (or heats up...not sure which) faster than the surrounding water?  I'm not sure at all but it was a very curious finding given the drastic difference in color from everything else in the image!
