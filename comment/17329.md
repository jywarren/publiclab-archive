Hi [@kimoyerr](/profile/kimoyerr),
As long as you get the first order diffraction to the camera the pipe's shape is of lesser importance(that's what I think). My first prototype was the paper/cardboard spectrometer with a different grating. Since the BOM cost is so low I'd recommend you try to make it work, feel free to post here if you want specific advice or even better - share your success!
