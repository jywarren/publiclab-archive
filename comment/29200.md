One hospital around used ethylene oxide sterizers.  They had a monitor outside the sterilizers to check on EtO levels.  This has been many years ago.  But a quick check showed ethylene oxide monitors are still available, but not cheap ($400 or more).  Don't know if these will work in environmental situations or not.
