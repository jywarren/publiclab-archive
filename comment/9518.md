visualizing data is hot right now, but this is some next level $#!%-- in-situ data landscape audiolization--- its so cutting edge the spellchecker doesn't think its a word.

Audio has a major advantage when looking at small differences-- instead of getting a really similar color, you'll hear a beat frequency in the interference between the tones.
