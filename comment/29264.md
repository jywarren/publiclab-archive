My purpose is strictly to measure.  The cleanup part is not my strong point, so it must be left to someone else.  But to go on with the testing.  The " oil and grease " test takes water samples and used chemical means to separate the "oil and grease" from it.  That part is pretty easy.  Getting an idea of how much oil and grease is in there isn't too dificult , either. Separating the individual components is a little more difficult, but that might be a way to identify the source of each bit of oil. It just might not work, though.
