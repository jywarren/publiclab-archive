As for the mortar and pestle, there are many options.  Some mortar and pestles are very expensive, but they don't have to be. They should be easy to clean and non porous.  And the pestle should be easy to grasp. Usually , we would raid the stopper drawer for a single hole stopper.  Then, the stopper would go over the top of the pestle.  It made it easier for some of the common grinding operations that go on in the lab.
