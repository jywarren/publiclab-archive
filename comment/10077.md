You're right - it's a pretty high baseline. Something like 10%, no? I believe this is noise, but some may be related to infrared reflectivity inside the chamber -- we've found that it's hard to get a completely absorbent interior and the cameras are pretty sensitive to IR light once the filter's gone. 

This particular test was done with paper that's not dark in the infrared range, too. I think we do a lot better when we use fully "infradark" materials, as in this example: https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/14919
