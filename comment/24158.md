 I've rebooted a couple of times now, and keep having the same thing happen.  I also tried switching to the main Raspian OS img.  With that, I am able to get all the way to the OS, and get online.  However on Spectral Workbench, the camera does not come up on the capture page.  I can however take a pic using command lines.
