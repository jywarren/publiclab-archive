This is great. 
I spoke with the Project Nola owner about this concept when we were working on the Urban Water Plan. 
He stated that he monitors radio traffic from EMS folks and on heavy rain days there is a lot of chatter about streets flooding between first responders (streets to avoid, etc). He thought that logging that type of information would be very useful. Once you know the location of the flooding, then you can go and check the camera data.
