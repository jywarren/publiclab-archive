- Ah, you didn't fail at all -- I just keep dithering about the final design, and have been hestitating to hit 'print' :)  But I think this might be converging to a 'printable' design rapidly.  And anyway -- it's only, like, $4 for 3 of them, at OSH Park.  I'll double-check the design tonight -- and shall we then shoot for Tuesday as [FISI / FIPI](http://pvos.org/fipi.png) day?
