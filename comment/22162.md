I don' t know what a "dedicated IR camera" is. You can use an appropriate red filter on a full spectrum camera to capture mostly NIR in the blue channel and mostly red in the red channel.

With an appropriate camera and filter, and with an appropriate calibration or custom white balance, NDVI values for healthy foliage in sunlight will be between 0.2 and 0.8 and NDVI values for non-foliage will be below 0.2.
