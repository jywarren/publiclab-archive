Thanks [@warren](/profile/warren). I think since this project allows for printing out PDF form option, those who want true anonymity can choose to just skip the map, yet their location can be known to those that need (and will keep secure) the data.  Perhaps the blurred map option could be a future "Summer of Code" project?
