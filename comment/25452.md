[@stevie](/profile/stevie), [@warren](/profile/warren), [@jeffalk](/profile/jeffalk), [@Aleah](/profile/Aleah) and [@Cbarnes9](/profile/Cbarnes9). Our issue with the data files is to be able to amalgamate numerous 24-hour csv files that are written to the PurpleAir sd card into a single Excel workbook so we can analyze and plot all the data.

Four such files are attached to this note. Any help would be appreciated. (Having trouble dragging and dropping the four files into this post.)
