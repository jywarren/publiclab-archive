Answers to the questions you have posted If a user logs in via facebook and then sign ups via twitter then he will be logged in. the user will have two identities one for the fb and the other for the twitter.
If a person logs in through the current account via password and then links his account via facebook, then there would be a single account. The user will be able to access the same account by any alternative.
