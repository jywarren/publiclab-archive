Cute little webcam.  I'm assuming this has an MJPEG encoder onboard, otherwise it would monopolize the netbook's USB...unless they use a separate controller only for that purpose - don't really know what is cheaper.  It looks like there are a few ICs on the board which is a good sign; whereas, the SYBA is mostly just a sensor with a few resistors and caps - typical of a lot of cheap "empty-box" USB devices that use a lot of resources from the host and have buggy complicated drivers.

BTW, I found it was much easier to remove the whole lens assembly from the SYBA by unscrewing it from behind rather than melting the glue and wrenching the barrel out.  This way you don't have to refocus... but maybe you guys want to refocus anyway for the spectrometer app?
