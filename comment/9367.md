On anemometers-- 
learn the Beaufort scale and watch the tops of trees-- since wind speed on the ground is less important than high up, Beaufort is more useful than an anemometer. its not as precise, but its more accurate and useful.  I had a pocket anemometer for a while but it wasn't worth it. I don't use one anymore.
