Just a note on accessibility - if we (continue to) use Bootstrap, it has accessible HTML features designed for screen readers built-in, as long as we follow their examples. So this makes it easier for folks who use screen readers to use our software, when compared to completely custom HTML features (although if we use those, we can manually implement such screen-reader compatibility as well!).
