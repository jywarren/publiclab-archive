Update for week fourteen: I have begun working on putting together my literature review using the literature I have found over the past couple of weeks. I am also working on creating a code that allows me to automatically control the LED lights. Additionally, I am modifying my list of materials needed to be purchased in order to piece together my prototype after reading into which materials would be more beneficial over others in making my product successful.
