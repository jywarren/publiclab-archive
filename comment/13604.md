Ok, I got a fresh copy of Chrome to work so here's a Solux 4700K spectrum which was callibrated with a 'CFL2700K' new cal data. https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/71409
However, the data download is also broken as there is no wavelength data (all zeros) in the CSV format and 'null' in the XML format -- unless some other new feature must be run besides the 'calibrate' function to get that wavelength data to be included.
