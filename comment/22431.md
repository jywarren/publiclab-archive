Chris' answer is great. I was also going to write in about radish seeds specifically, and generally the need for warmth to signal seeds to sprout. I also like the idea about other observable phenomena -- reminds me of a drawing exercise where we had to keep a green bell pepper on our desk and draw it every day for a month.
