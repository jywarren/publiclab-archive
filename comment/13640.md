Understood; though independent checks and tests are still the best method to find hidden anomalies and overlooked issues. When you fix the glitch, I'd expect the ends of the corrected plot to show dramatic error expansion as the camera sensitivity goes to near zero -- i.e. this should be really obvious in the plot.
