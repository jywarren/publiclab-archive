I'm just presenting on your great post on the NASA AREN call right now (https://publiclab.org/aren) and we have questions!

1. did you illuminate these separately at separate times?
2. did you use the same, full-open camera and only change the light, instead of filtering separately?

Very cool! Folks on the call are excited about this test and would love to learn more!
