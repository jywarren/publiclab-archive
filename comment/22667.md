Hi there, great question. Bringing an answer over from [@thegreencommunitygarden](/profile/thegreencommunitygarden) that was sent out on the main list: "Try the local cooperative extension office.  But from experience, if produce was submerged in flood waters, they should not be consumed."

Also, here's a link to the gardening tool kit on Public Lab: https://publiclab.org/wiki/gardening-toolkit
