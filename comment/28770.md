Looking at formaldehyde, VOC, and ambient air levels.
Chasing air pollution is challenging, these effects are transient and hard to capture. Large room for error if not strategic. A focused sampling effort for what you should be looking for helps when it comes to lab testing -- which is usually the most expensive factor besides time spent out in the field [collecting the samples].  Is recommendable to test almost every day and during an odor event. Practice in your backyard.
