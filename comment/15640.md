Yes I have no problem with that. It is however more involved than other projects I see on this site. It needs a lot of  fine soldering (maybe a PCB could be fabricated to make this easier). It also requires a microprocessor and the knowledge and equipment to program it (I can make my software available). And of course some optical alignment is needed to get the light to hit the diode array (preferably in focus) and give the required wavelength range.
