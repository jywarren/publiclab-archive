Hi, I am not really sure how this works  bit I think GSOC discussions moves over to github, https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2653, which is  replicated to Gitter.   https://gitter.im/publiclab/soc.  In any case,  really impressed with your  opencv work, https://publiclab.org/notes/amirberAgain/01-12-2018/python-and-opencv-to-analyze-microscope-slide-images-of-airborne-particles and wondering if you could recommend any opencv teaching guides or ‘how to’ manuals?
