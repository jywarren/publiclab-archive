Today, I learned that microplastics the size of of a strand of hair can be lodged in the most vital organs that clean out the blood (liver, kidneys, etc.) Microplastics can enter our bloodstreams through the clothes we wear, the foods we eat, etc. We consume microplastics unintentionally and  unknowingly everyday. If we were to use more multi-use plastics it could possibly cut down on the amount of plastic in the world.
