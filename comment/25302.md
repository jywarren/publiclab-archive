here's an update on my own question about the pole mapping kit.

you can make the camera rig workable as shown in the pics below. However, it is fixed and does not adjust via gravity to the pole angle.that means that when you change the angle of your pole the camera angle also changes, it does not self level. honestly it's not a very good system.
