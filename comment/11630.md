Updated 5/15-
 I added most recent changes to the section entitled "8Bit vs 32Bit?"  Even if this page has been quiet for the past few months, I've actually been working on it quite a bit.  Unfortunately, this is mainly because I had to start from scratch in order to upgrade to a 32bit firmware...  Now that the weather is warming again, I hope to get in the air soon!
