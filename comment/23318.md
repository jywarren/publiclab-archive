 You can see a little more about the copper corrosion tests on the Methods Page for the Copper Pipe Method, (there are supplies to experiment with this method available in the Public Lab store)-- the copper pipe method is one that still has some open questions, so we'd love to see more people give it a shot in the field. You can also find a little more information about testing methods on the Hydrogen Sulphide Detection wiki, but I've also come across some cool info about H2S detecting in wine-making forums-- could be an interesting place to look for additional DIY methods.
