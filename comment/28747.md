[@Kennicka_HaganKarr](/profile/Kennicka_HaganKarr) check out this response from sarasage to learn more about the US Environmental Protection Agency's air monitoring efforts. 

One of the best ways you can can get more awareness around local air quality concerns where you are is to share the information you're learning with others in your community! The more people that know about the concern, you can discuss taking action collectively. Perhaps your classmates are interested in writing a letter of concern to a local representative in your local government (town, city, or state level)!
