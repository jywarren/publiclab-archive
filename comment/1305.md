Did you use a scanner to capture the test strips' colors? I think if you scan them as a TIFF file, then the color data will all be preserved.  If uploaded to Mapknitter as TIFFs, then someone else could download a GeoTIFF with erfectly preserved color data and geospacial data.

I love seeing this project come along! great work on these and the testing kit.
