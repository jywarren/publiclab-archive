Okay, I read the research paper and the heat convection air flow dependent on the sensor orientation.

I also found this report which describes the PM sizing capability.  Still skeptical of being able to determine particle size in this unit: http://aqicn.org/sensor/shinyei/

Some more food for thought on aerodynamic particle sizing http://www.tsi.com/uploadedFiles/_Site_Root/Products/Literature/Brochures/3321%20Operation%20brochure%20US-5001468_WEB.pdf

TSI has many published paper too, but I don't have the links handy.
