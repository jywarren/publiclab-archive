 There are several manufacturers of handheld XRF analyzers. And yes, they are usually cost limited.  The cost can be reduced somewhat by renting, instead of buying.

The handhelds still have to be optimized for the element.  Some use radioactive sources instead of xray tubes, and will be more sensitive to different elements because of this.  

Often, the handhelds use beryllium windows. Beryllium is a nasty and expensive element.  Something to watch out for when renting.
