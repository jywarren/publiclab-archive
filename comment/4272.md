This is really interesting. 

In the photograph of the three test tubes, which drink is which? (you can enter a caption)

In the set of three spectra, the peaks of Neurosonic and Monster seem to line up well, but the peaks of Red Bull seem to be shifted to the right.  Do you think all three spectra are calibrated the same?
