doesn't look like much of a fight-- the ABS wins hands-down in that last photo.  The warping of the diffraction grating mount-plate for the PP version is going to create trouble by "doming" out the diffraction grating.

I wish we could go with the more easily recycleable, solvent-resistant plastic (PP), but I don't think we can.

Can't wait to play with them myself!
