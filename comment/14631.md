I have decided to suspend my current turbidity sensor and instead adapt yours to my base station. If it is of interest I have modeled the mechanical parts in openscad and you are welcome to the files.

Also building a PCB to fit your chamber. Schematic is ready except for exact values of components (made a rough guess).

Some questions:
  I am unclear as the to location of the pipe with air bubble vents.
  Is the chamber with LED and PhotoTransistor wet?
  Is the 45 degree angle for LED and transistor important?
  Where did you get the black PCV parts?
