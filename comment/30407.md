In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act to remove toxic substances from water to protect others and to keep it clean. In 1976, the country passed the Toxic Substances Control Act to control the use of chemical substances in the water and food as well. In that same year, the Marine Mammal Protection was passed. There were many different carcinogenic factors inside the drinking water. The military knew about these water problems but didnâ€™t do anything to stop it. As a result of this, a class action lawsuit took place.
