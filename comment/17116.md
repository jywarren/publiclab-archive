Hi [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke). I kinda let this project fall though the cracks. I did have the sensor working pretty well, the only issue was interference from stray light. Since then I have found this supplier of photodiodes with integrated optical filters (https://www.intorfilters.com/product-page/880-10-45). I think the optical filter on the detector would greatly improve the design. I have bought some supplies to make a similar sensor for chlorophyll with the optically filtered photodiode, just haven't gotten around to putting it together...
