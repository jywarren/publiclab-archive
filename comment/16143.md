Hey Glenn! 

Thanks for the words, and MY apologies for not getting back sooner. Working full-time and taking a full course-load of classes, so doing my best to keep up, but falling behind here and there every now and then. Here's to multiple disciplines and competing priorities, right? :) 

I'll shoot word over when I have more thoughts on what data/techniques/material, etc might be useful. I'll be looking into that and doing some research this week. I think this might be a bit of a challenge to find appropriate parameters, methods and such, but I'm definitely looking forward to trying. Be well.
