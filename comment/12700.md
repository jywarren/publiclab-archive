I'm happy to post my dissertation, but it has nothing to do with this (it explores natural Hg isotopic composition and fractionation in the marine environment -- nothing to do with CFLs and fluorescence -- I actually learned from one experiment that is not included in my dissertation that Hg from wastewater treatment plants that sterilize with UV Hg lamps have craaaaaaaazy isotopic composition).
