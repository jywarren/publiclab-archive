_For sure we are! We are developing an inclusive [#citizenscience](/tag/citizenscience) methodology in the framework of [@dNOSES_EU](/profile/dNOSES_EU) to create collaborative [#odour](/tag/odour) maps! You can try the free App [@Odourcollect](/profile/Odourcollect) to map odours globally! A new version has been just launched for Android Odourcollect.eu_
