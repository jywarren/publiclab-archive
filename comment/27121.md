Anecdotally here, we have birds nesting on our downtown windowsill, and just much less dirt and dust floating in the window, as well as fewer exhaust or asphalt smells. I wonder how many dimensions of data could show this systematically - from health data to plant productivity to temperature changes, to changes in thermal patterns in urban surfaces. Great question!
