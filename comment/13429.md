Other people have commented elsewhere how "trimmers" (capacitors with adjustable capacitance) exist, which would be a useful way to "tune" the sound, in addition to swapping out capacitors.

There are also updated discussions elsewhere about measuring conductivity, adapting this circuit to get better accuracy. https://publiclab.org/tag/conductivity
