This is a great description of strategy [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) ! Would you consider adding it in to the second paragraph on the wiki, under https://publiclab.org/wiki/public-comment#What+can+public+comment+achieve? , or perhaps starting a new paragraph for municipal level public comment? It is more specific than the description of strategy that is currently there.
