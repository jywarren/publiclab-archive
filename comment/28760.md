[@seankmcginnis](/profile/seankmcginnis) Yes, you are correct that our ideal future state would be a single device.

To answer your questions, we are using iOS devices and we are lacking in organizational hardware skills. Between members of my household, we can put together easy to intermediate Arduino projects. I would have to recruit an unknown someone in the community who has these types of skills to do anything more advanced.
