Thanks for the offer but I think I have just found a decent UK supplier ... http://www.knightoptical.com ... who do wratten gelatin filters (expensive) but also polyster (not to pricey) and some even cheaper acrylic ones that seem to pass similar wavelengths to the wratten 25a ... im thinking I might get this one http://www.knightoptical.com/_public/documents/1372681789_585nmlongpassfilteracryliccolour585fap.pdf :)
