Our spectrometer is pretty amazing. Your comments are right on, I certainly recommend avoiding clipping (the warning in SpectralWorkbench works really well). The spectrometer's calibration was very sensitive to bumping â€“ and stoft's explorations of harder builds look really useful. It was really useful to do the calibration, and then just take the wavelengths from the saved and exported calibration spectrum.
