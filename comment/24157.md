Thank you reading it! Yes I noticed the analytical contributions referencing the Github stats were on the final report... just pulled them right back in here! 

Do you see any opportunities for improving this research note? Feel free to co-collaborate on it if you'd like! Right now it just seems a little disorganized to me

But would love your thoughts / input
