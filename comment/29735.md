I got one of the 254 nm UVC lamps that might be usable for an uv/vis instrument as a gift . It's advertised as for sterilization of surfaces.  The one purchased was" fbfl for portable uv". It's a mercury lamp in sheep's wool.  It's powered by three "AA" batteries.  And the mercury lamp is the smallest I've ever seen.  There are many precautions that need to be taken with UVC light, including eye protection. Mercury disposal(as well as mercury breakage) will also be an issue.  The led version out there might be better. But still, be careful using any of them.
