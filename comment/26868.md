Great! CCing [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) and [@danbeavers](/profile/danbeavers) and [@warren](/profile/warren) about also possibly attending next Tuesday's open call. That will be Tuesday, May 26 at 2:45pm Eastern US -- all time zones shown here https://everytimezone.com/?t=5ecc5c00,465

Also [@warren](/profile/warren), can you connect the dots to the person in Brooklyn who i seem to remember you mentioning had had prior success pulling down images from satellites? Thanks!
