I'm interested in working on some NDVI software development while waiting to get my Superblue filters from Kickstarter.  Could you share some unprocessed images that I could use for development?  I'm not sure if the files you were sharing via torrent were processed or not, but the torrent doesn't seem to be active anymore.

Thanks,
Robert
