Maybe under "How to participate" -- we could try a 3-column thing for:

1. Ask a question: https://publiclab.org/questions
2. Post an issue brief: https://publiclab.org/issue-brief
3. Create a project page: (although we need a page describing this: https://publiclab.org/wiki/wiki-templates)

designed like https://code.publiclab.org's 3 steps.
