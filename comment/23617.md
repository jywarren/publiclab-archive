 Thanks a lot [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren), will fully complete the proposal today with full implementation part.

Indeed, making the capture part as a separate library will indeed help in making the code modular, maintaining the code base and also ease the development process. Ultimately, making it easier for everyone to understand and contribute to it. 

Thanks ðŸ˜ƒ
