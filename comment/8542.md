Wrote a comment, but it does not show up. damn. once again!

Thanks a lot for the instructions!

My question is: if i remove the internal filter, can i also take normal pics with the cam AND IR pictures? 
Did i understood it right, if i remove the internal IR filter, it takes "normal" pics, and then i run them trough a software and then i get my  IR-Pic (the white leafes for example) ?

English is not my mothers tongue, so please help me! ;)

Thanks a lot!
