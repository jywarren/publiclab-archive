[@liz](/profile/liz) Thanks for your sincere thoughts on the ideas. It's great to have your views. Yeah I do support the tradition of Publiclab. Barnstar system is a great way of comunity appreciation. I am also not finalized my mind on the structure of the commenting system and would be happy to receive more suggestions on it and on the design. Though I think a Answer model would go a long way on organizing the  Q and A system. Thanks gain for your views on this.
