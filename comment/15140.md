Hey [@stevie](/profile/stevie)! I have made a wiki page on Q & A and added some documentation on Posting and answering Question following your suggestions. Here it is: https://publiclab.org/wiki/public-lab-q-and-a. Please have a look at it and feel free to make any changes in the documentation. Look out for the format as I have written it in html to use the bootstrap grid system and responsive classes.
I have added Some documentation in the Question page itself too and linked the wiki page to the Question page.It will be coming soon after [@warren](/profile/warren) makes some revision in the PR [#666](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/666)
