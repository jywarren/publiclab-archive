[@rockets](/profile/rockets) Yeah, I was going too fast and assumed that the parts list was good. I still need to order the ORP SEN0165. If you can tell me the SKUs for:
-  the data adapter and cable to bring what I have up to the SEN0169 and
- the cables for the two isolation modules, then

I'm okay with paying the difference and having them all shipped at the same time as the ORP.
