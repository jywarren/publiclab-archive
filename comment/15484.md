Update:  actually, nevermind :)  I've read more about error detection codes, and I'm learning that there might be better / easier ways of implementing error detection that won't require messing with SoftModem or the main Webjack code.  Will post further updates as I learn more ...  but meanwhile, don't waste your brain energy on my previous proposal, as it doesn't seem like the best way to go (at least, from my perspective now).  Cheers!
