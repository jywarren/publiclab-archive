Also - I like the idea of microscope slides, except that glass strongly absorbs UV <400nm. I'm not sure of how well the pi NoIR is on that range but for now I'd rather have as little material in the optical path as possible. I haven't tested out UV yet at all, since I only measured light indoors and the sunlight through my window should be pretty depleted of UV due to the glass.
