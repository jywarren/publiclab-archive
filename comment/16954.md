[@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker), 

[@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) use DFRobot EC probe.
I am using EC_mini_v31

we are two different person :) using 2 different devices for a similar project (both try to monitor an aqurium/pond/something like that) and was exchanging some comment about that.

notice that the nickname on the EC_mini_v31 it's mine not shanlter :)
