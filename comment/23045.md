Here's an answer coming in from Ann Marie Carlton who works with an [Atmospheric Multiphase Chemistry Research Group at University of California, Irvine](https://thecarltongroup.wordpress.com/)! 

"There are several examples in the scientific literature of biochar adsorption for ammonia. I found one manuscript that described removal of H2S with biochar in a digester. I *think* biochar could work for ammonia in a straightforward way. The time to breakthrough (when it stops working) would depend on a lot of variables: ammonia concentration, pH of the char and relative humidity of the air. For H2S removal, it's less clear that it would work in an easy straightforward way, but maybe."
