That's a good question. I updated the [wiki page](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infrablue-white-balance) to make it clear that the white balance procedure should be done on an Infragram camera with the blue filter in place. Many different blue surfaces will work. The color of the light when you do the white balance is also important. If it is sunny and blue outside when you do it, put your blue surface under a blue sky and shade it from direct sunlight. If there is no blue sky, try it anyway. Then take some photos of plants. If foliage is orangey yellow, you are good to go.
