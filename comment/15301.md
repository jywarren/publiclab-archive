Hi, Chris - this is great -- i imagine it may be featured as an activity on, say, the [#balloon-mapping](/tag/balloon-mapping) or [#aerial-mapping](/tag/aerial-mapping) pages. With that in mind, perhaps a title change could help people better understand what an "Aerobee" is in this context -- maybe like "Make the Aerobee Rig to protect and point your camera"... or something in that general vein?
