[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) Hello I'm working on a project in which we see how a person's exposure to plants affects them. Currently we have a wearable sensor with three photo resistors on it. One has an infrared filter, one had green, and the other has no filter. This reads each value every second and records it. We then compare the IR and green values to the levels of visible light to get a reading of how many plants are nearby. My question is weather this method is viable since range is something we are worried about or should we switch to using a camera and just record the NDVI values that it gives.
