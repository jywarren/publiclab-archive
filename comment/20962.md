Hi! The simplest (and cheapest) conductivity sensor I can think of is the [Coqui](https://publiclab.org/wiki/coqui)-- we have a recent blog post about it [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/kanarinka/10-23-2018/introducing-the-coqui-it-s-a-frog-and-a-tool), and I would imagine with some tinkering it could be used with a logger, but as Chris suggests, if you're planning to use something on site, you may not need this part.  [@kanarinka](/profile/kanarinka) is one of the people behind the Coqui, perhaps she's got some suggestions?
