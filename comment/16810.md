As cfastie noticed this line
 RTC.adjust(DateTime((__DATE__), (__TIME__))); 
reset the RTC to the same time every... time the setup is fired
that's because the compiler substitute the compiling time into __DATE__ and __TIME__ just before compiling.
You have to remove this line and possibly to add a system to set time because DS1307 may lose seconds every day or you have to switch to and from daylight saving time unless you use UTC.
