Hi [@madtinker](/profile/madtinker), oh there's interest!
as [@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) said, the best place to document your build is by clicking the blue button "Click here to replicate this activity" right above this comment section here on this page. Since no one has yet documented deployment, consider posting a new note about your work on that via publiclab.org/post

how does this sound?
