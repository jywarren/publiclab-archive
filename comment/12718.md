I pasted Grapherate live graphs for 4 sensors Mathew set up into this page: http://publiclab.org/wiki/open-air -- not sure if these are those used on a live test at the moment, but it's easy to paste in the public keys of Phant streams to generate the graphs. I can also help clean up the graph presentation a bit.
