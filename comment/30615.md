The species in the image are gulf killifish, sheepshead minnows, oyster killifish, diamond killifish, brown shrimp, and white shrimp. They will be greatly affected from coastal restoration projects because their environments and ponds will become isolated, and fish that evolved to rely on saltwater from the Gulf will either die out or be forced to move. This is known as environmental succession. It happens all the time as mankind progresses the environment regresses.
