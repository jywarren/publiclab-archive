My search was really quick, the terms I used were "DIY sidescan fish finder." a little deeper digging found that the hummingbird forum has a bunch of DIY "towfish" which are the housing for the hummingbird transducer.  While not the actual sonar itself, the housing and tow system are a major part of the design problem.
