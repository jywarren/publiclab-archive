It's ok to have a 'scaled' data file -- but ONLY if that file is clearly identified as such ... like /SpectrumData-SCALED_20160420.csv  or /SpectrumDataCALD-SCALED_20160420.csv, etc..  Otherwise, yes, all csv data files should be in native resolution (8-bit) for now. [@Warren](/profile/Warren) and I have had discussions about this general topic but I think results have yet to be implemented in SWB.

I have difficult with SWB (the UI, latency, hung scripts, etc) so I don't bother with it and use Matlab instead. I can read the USB camera directly at many frames per sec and then manipulate and plot easily. None of that is available with SWB.
