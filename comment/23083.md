Kite messengers could support a nano computer device, but for what purpose?  I'm not sure.  I've always liked Scott sleds as kites, not because of their lifting ability, but because you could almost always find the materials to make them.  

Another interesting kite device from college was a kite "train".  It was sponsored by an art department (science dept gave up on kites long ago).  They used common diamond kites you find in the local grocery store, but about 100 of them.  They were tied at about 50ft intervals on a thick piece of rope.  It really increased the lift ability.
