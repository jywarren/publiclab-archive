This looks great, thank you for sharing! How long has it been out there, and do you have a sense of the battery life? How often are you shooting? 

We're collecting documentation on setup here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/timelapse -- any chance you've taken some snaps of how you set it up and pointed it?

Thank you!
