Benjamin Hickman posted his early results from a linear array spectrometer here: http://publiclab.org/notes/bhickman/10-12-2013/ccd-diodearray-spectrometer. But his hardware was a little different.

There might be some good information in the links there. If you comment on that note he will probably be notified and might be able to help.
