Hi [@JorgeHM](/profile/JorgeHM) the most common reason for this is the ribbon cable being inserted backwards (it's quite confusing, both ends could be reversed so 4 possible ways to connect it and only 1 is correct :-///) OR for the tiny ribbon connector between the lens and the camera circuit board to be mis-seated. Sometimes it's not 100% inserted or it's not flat. Try making sure it's firmly seated and try restarting?
