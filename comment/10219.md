Pinoccio is an open source / open hardware solution that makes data collection a breeze. It runs on Arduino and makes everyone's life considerably easier.

I'm unsure how well their interface supports actuators. Since it is open source and open hardware and super pretty, it might be something to look into modifying rather than rolling your own.
