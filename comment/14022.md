Mathew, thanks. It's an interesting technique, though not without some added work to characterize a diffusion surface and assure bulb stability. I also thought it interesting that they claimed the shorter wavelength point as an outlyer, they just assign light leakage at the total cause, did not remeasure and decided to just publish anyway. Hmmm. They also claimed 15% accuracy because their bulb sampling had that data spread. As a substitute standard, I'm not sure that is sufficient proof -- but still, it's an interesting method.
