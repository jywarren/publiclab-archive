Hi, Ernesto - sorry, didn't see your question until now. There's a discussion of the ribbed cuvettes here: http://publiclab.org/notes/Cindy_ExCites/11-04-2015/oil-testing-kit-beta-programme-technical-adjustments-hack#c12858

If the ribbed side faces the spectrometer, they should be fine. What did you find?
