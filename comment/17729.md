Hi! Here's a good place to post questions about fluorescence: https://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit#Questions

Or, just at https://publiclab.org/tag/fluorescence -- there's a button there -- and it's helpful to keep questions separate so we don't mix all the answers together. Don't be afraid to post several!
