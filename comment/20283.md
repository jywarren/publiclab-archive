Awesome ðŸŽ‰ did you find that the lego piece also worked? Obviously we have legos in the kits already ðŸ˜› 

But if not, we can run off a large # of the adapters and put one in each. Thanks so much! Would you be willing to post a new note with a few more photos illustrating the lens focusing steps? The comparison is very encouraging!
