Hi, I'm trying to think how we can support and connect this work to the microscope team more -- could we post a call for images to try to run through this workflow? Both reference images and test images from DIY microscopes?

Maybe as a follow-on to this question: https://publiclab.org/questions/gretchengehrke/09-21-2017/is-it-possible-to-discern-jagged-from-rounded-particles-using-a-diy-microscope
