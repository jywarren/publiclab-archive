<i>Many companies do "bore" holes before they start mining. One requirement in the state of WI is that those bore holes be sealed so that contaminants do not get into the ground water below. If the company has indeed accomplished borings, the DNR must be notified in order to check out whether or not those holes have appropriately been sealed off. Water contamination is serious and can impact the drinking water of many. In some cases, companies have actually asked that land owners sign "gag order" agreements with the requirement that land owners not report such violations which makes it even more serious. I recommend that the DNR be contacted or the Land Conservation Agent in your county be notified.</i>
