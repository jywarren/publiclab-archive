yes the tri-copters do look sexy...by video do you mean an NDVI or just a normal vision video? i do see alot of false returns and noise in my images so i think white balance is a problem.

As far as the tricopters, i love them, if you build them right they're just as stable as quads', hexs' and octos'. the advantage (in my opinion) is that only the bi and tri copters give you real true yaw. the other machines just give a psuedo- yaw kind of approximation. with instrumentation being aimed, we'd like real yaw.the price we pay is a little servo, hinge and link to tilt the rear motor.

here's a kickstarter of mine...  it does have a few videos.
