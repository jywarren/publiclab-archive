 It's going from 0-250 ug/m3 (and the x-axis is 42 days).The average value (over 6 weeks) is 17 ug/m3. So the graph shows there are some large spikes (going over 250) but these are not very short lived. I don't know they could be spurious electrical noise but many graphs I've seen show similar low background with large spikes.
I've moved the device to a new location so I will see if the readings stay the same.
It's a pity the graph lost most of its clarity when I uploaded.
