Great thanks for the tips. Mosquito prevention is an important thing to remember.

You can poke holes in the soda bottle's top to make a screen, though it would be hard to remove to clean depending on your design. Great for a one-time experiment, though.

You can also make an improvised rain catcher by attaching a small gardening tray without holes to the top and drilling drainage holes into the bottle.
