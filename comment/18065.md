I didn't but I wish I had.  I would suggest creating a template for an 'inner sleeve' or something of that sort which could be made with dark paper and inserted before folding and taping everything together.

Also, I will be blogging about this soon on People, Planet, Profits, and Projects - a blog about sustainability in Project Management: https://www.projectmanagement.com/blogs/264100/People--Planet--Profits---Projects
