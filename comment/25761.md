Hi Will! What do you think of a really basic version of this, shipped assembled, something like a "Simple Turbidity Sensor"? 

This could help us jump start some work on how to get this into a waterway without, like, dipping the whole thing in water and short circuiting it.

Assume we can assemble them here and mail them out to people... what might that look like? Should we put them into a box or something? A mason jar?
