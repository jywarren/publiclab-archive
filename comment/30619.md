Coastal Marsh Restoration causes environmental allogenic succession in Louisiana wetlands. Allogenic succession is when external abiotic factors change the environment. This project of restoration can cause fish like Gulf Killifish, Sheeps head minnow, Oyster Killifish, Diamond Killifish, Brown Shrimp & White Shrimp to suffer. The fresh water will be flushed out letting saltwater in. This project will cause the decrease in population because fish would have to attempt to strive with saltwater. Species will decrease and die. The species of fish will be limited making the market for fish limited to people which causes a deduction in the market.
