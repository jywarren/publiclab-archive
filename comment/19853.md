Huh, this looks almost perfect. Can you upload a picture of it with a light in the frame? I don't see any rainbow effects. Can you also send a pic of your DVD slice and its orientation over the camera? I worry it's not angled correctly and you're not generating a spectrum. You ought to see a bunch of rainbows here from these various lights!

Sorry it took a while to read through all the responses here but i'm glad you're getting help from [@pushpaw](/profile/pushpaw) too!
