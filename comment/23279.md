I suspect you have a problem with the vertical alignment of your camera. With the camera that originally shipped with the kit there wasn't room to get this wrong. The camera would really only fit one way.
I think you need to move the camera up or down - in the direction of the missing part of your spectrum.
Its either that or you have your diffraction grating at a funny angle. You don't have the grating in backwards do you?
A picture of the insides of your spectrometer might be helpful for diagnosis, showing the position of the gating and camera.
