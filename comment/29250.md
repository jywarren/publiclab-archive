Nice work.

The final goal here is to analyze the nutrient effect. Right?

The normal camera (Raspberry pi camera) can also get this type of result. If we plot the total area covered by the plant vs days, we also get this type of graph. What is the extra information we get here using NoIR camera?

The Raspberry pi camera is cheaper than Raspberry pi NoIR camera.
