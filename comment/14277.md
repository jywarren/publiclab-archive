BTW I wonder if we could find out more about the effects of the camera if you could do this same setup plus statistics again let's say with a green or red laser pointer. The wavelengths will stay the same but the changes in amplitude might then only come from the camera electronics...? (if the laser produces a steady beam, that is...)
