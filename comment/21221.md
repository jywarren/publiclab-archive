Hello again [@warren](/profile/warren) :) 

Two quick questions:

1. is it possible to upgrade my account to a moderator so that I can publish a wiki (see above)?
2. any preference on the carousel for the tags? Should I work on it, or should I remove it and keep the site as it was before? Please see here: https://edieblu.github.io/pl-welcome.io/

Please note that the project deadline is November 15. and I'm very eager to finish it on time :) 

Thank you!
