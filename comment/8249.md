It is true about that image. The slope was big and we had no better photo of that part of the mountain.

It was geometricaly incorrect. We just tried to make things fit. Apart from removing the image, I thought on splitting the image in two and knit again. 
The other solution is to get more height in the photos, I guess. Have you faced a similar problem?
