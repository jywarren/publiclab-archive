It depends how far from the infrastructure you will be monitoring and what infrastructure you will be monitoring. Some states have the geology for earthquakes, some don't. Some have wet gas (gas and oil) others have dry gas (just gas). Where are you planning on monitoring?  Noise is a pretty cheap sensor and is a very good indicator of activity. Also some rural counties have a decibel limit regulation for noise so it could actually have some traction.  Everyone seems to be gaga over http://www.alphasense.com sensors for gas detection.
