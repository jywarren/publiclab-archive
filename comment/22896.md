I have one more question. The experiment says to use the light setting 530nm: 

"Use the spectrophotometer to measure the Absorption and Transmittance percentage for each of the beet jars.Use the light setting 530 nm.Use the set of jars with no beets in them as the blank samples"

Why do they say to use 530nm light setting? If we make the spectrophotometer using DVD using the above steps you suggested, will the result be similar? or it will totally invalidate the test results?

I think if we have solution with different concentration we should see different curve in graph, that should be good enough to prove Absorption and Transmittance percentage. What do you think?

Thanks,
