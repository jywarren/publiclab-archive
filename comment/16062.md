Hi, I noted that on the [WebJack page](/wiki/webjack), the illustration shows the use of the 5v pin, but here it's not shown. Is it essential? I seem to have been transmitting without it, actually -- and I'm curious because why is a 4-pin cable necessary?

Ah - i think i figured it out -- even if we only use 3 pins, we need the extra ring to connect with the A/V port of a smartphone or similar device, since that's how we are using both input and output from that device. 

Thanks!
