Dear [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)! How are you? Joaquin from Aerocene project here. One of our community members, Fede from Buenos Aires, has created a Python code that allows to assign color to a KML flight trajectory according to another variable, such as tempreature, height or pollution. The code is freely available on our github: https://github.com/Aerocene/skyholemarkup
