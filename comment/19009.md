[@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1), thank you for your information and link.  I will try and follow the directions. At the moment, I am only interested in getting a digital format and be able to apply and using another software for measuring sizes and shapes. Usually, I work with particles sizes from 10 to 62 micron, silts and fine sand. The Raspberry Pi Camera looks a very attractive possibility. Thanks.
