Thanks, Guillaume851 - I've seen yours and it does look very rigid, thank you! Part of the design I'm [prototyping in my note here](/notes/warren/04-21-2016/prototype-of-easy-to-build-rigid-spectrometer-housing) is a design we could lasercut from acrylic and sell with our current kit, and that is easy to make from materials available everywhere in the world, even without a lasercutter.
