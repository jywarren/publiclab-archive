Hi [@kksgandhi](/profile/kksgandhi) - welcome to Public Lab! Thanks for sharing this opportunity. Are you able to share more about what kind of citizen science this pertains to? Does this game focus on environmental impacts, behavior, etc? Would be great for our community to know more so we can properly tag! Also if you have a link to your Northeastern University lab, that would be great too!
