[@warren](/profile/warren) , Yes jeff, oil under a UV laser pointer will fluoresce a "whitish blue" color, gasoline will fluoresce more "white" because it contains more phosphor, you can easily test this theory out on any gas or oil sample, it doesn't even have to penetrate the sample, the color will present itself on the surface as either whitish-blue or white.

Gasoline, even though it is refined, is still a petroleum product (an aromatic hydro carbon) with specific Benzene rings.
