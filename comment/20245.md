Quick update:

>> The grating orientation might be the thing.

I tried 4 * 2 = 8 combinations for the grating, and it didn't make any difference - in all cases, the camera gets entirely dark once I close the lid. I'll have to step read all the comments once again and think about what to do next...

I have also a spectrometer version for the mobile phone, so I'll what are the results with it and maybe it will help to figure out what is wrong.
