As far as I know the guide groove on a DVD+R would be indistinguishable from that on DVD-R as far as using it for a diffraction grating is concerned. All these disks, both double and single layer are constructed with two polycarboante layers. In the dual layer disks the upper disk has a dye layer and is used for recording, in the single it doesn't and isn't. I think they should split just the same.
