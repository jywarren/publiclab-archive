Nice work! Thanks for developing these tools. I've spent thousands of hours and many thousands of dollars detecting, collecting, and analyzing oil from the BP disaster. A spectrometer like yours would have been very useful for field testing and deciding which samples warranted shipping off for GCMS testing. If you have not already seen it, you may be interested in some research I helped with. We used high power UV lights(365NM, we actually helped develop the light) to aid in discovery of oil on our beach. The weathered crude had a very distinctive orange glow. GCMS testing repeatedly confirmed a MC252 fingerprint to our samples. http://emeraldcoast.surfrider.org/2012/04/surfrider-foundation-oil-study-reports-available-for-download/.
