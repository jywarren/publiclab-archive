Hi Joe - is the map you're working on in MapKnitter the vineyard map? How did that flight go?

I'm really eager to see how folks from vineyards see DIY infrared maps. I think it's an exciting opportunity for grassroots mappers to provide key info to growers, and maybe a chance to earn some $ to pay for our balloon habit :-)
