Thanks for this.  Do you have any thoughts on the difference between ESA/Code De vs Earthengine (https://earthengine.google.com/) for obtaining satellite remote sensing data?   
Interested in :
Do they both offer the same datasets? ( I know they both offer Sentinel  but would ESA have a bigger selection than google/earthengine?) 
Which one is most likely  to grant  approval/access for beginners?  
Which one has the best method for finding  areas/times of interest?
