Super.  Oh, and I meant to say - the hexagonal holes are deliberately oversized, they taper down at the end to grip the nut firmly.  The idea is you should be able to push-fit the nut (at least well enough that it stays in until you screw into it from the other side) then fully tighten it by screwing the thumbwheel tight.  If I can sort out putting the elastic bands in from the bottom, this will all flow much better in the assembly.
