Yes, I noticed that in your note you mentioned that tallow turns color in the fall and nothing else does. So you won't even need IR to distinguish it. That will make life much easier. At other times of year, or to distinguish the other plants from one another, IR can be helpful. Around here you need to time the fall photos carefully because color happens fast. I tried to identify some trees in the snapshots of this late October gigapan: http://www.gigapan.com/gigapans/35627. Every week is completely different.
