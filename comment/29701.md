From Dr. Smith's experiment, I learned that humans might already have many microplastics within them.  There are other ways microplastics can invade the body besides eating or drinking.  Microplastics can make their way into our system by just using plastic products.  Even just surrounding yourself with plastic products could leave you at risk of microplastics getting into your body.
