Stu, thanks. Yes, there's still much to be understood about the performance limitations.

Jeff, the app is in matlab though it could probably be constructed in scilab as well. It's very hard to design experiments w/o the option to develop measurement tools along the way. These are great environments for development but probably difficult for general consumption. However, I don't mind sharing concepts and techniques.
