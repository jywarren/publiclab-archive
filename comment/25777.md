Obviously we love to see any improved 3d printed parts and would love to add to the design. Just so people know, we try to print these to be solid, but also:

* quick to print
* printable on different quality printers
* one piece
* possible to either glue, tape, or screw in (ideally)
* small so many can be printed at once on the same bed

Thanks all!
