Hmm. I only use Picasa for this "quick scrolling" preview purpose, and because it instantly gives me a map with the location if there is EXIF data. I use it for nothing else. I haven't had to link it to any Google Plus evil, so.   

I actually sort photos using file names and file folders. i'm kind of old school. all my photos get archived on harddrives.

thanks for the tips
