Here is my Progress on the [Expanded Q & A System Project](https://publiclab.org/notes/ananyo2012/03-25-2016/expanded-q-a-system-for-publiclab-org)

<blockquote>As mentioned in the plots2 pull request <a href = "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/550">#550</a> I have written controller actions and views for Questions controller and wrote basic functional tests for questions and notes controller. The initial views for the question index and show page can be seen in the images in the pull request.
