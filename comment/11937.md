Hey guys. I'm building a similar system, but instead of Shinyei PPD-42, I am using SHARP GP2Y1010AU0F dust sensor. However, I am not sure whether this sensor needs fan to direct air into the chamber or not. Does this sensor has that resistor heating elements too?

Any advice would be much appreciated! thank you!
here's the datasheet for that sensor.
