[@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) did you have the opportunities to talk with dfrobot team?

i have purchased a ph shield from them, and after some experiment i noticed that without isolate salinity reading are just impossible due to noise from EC (same apply on the opposite obviusly)

multiplexing them, doesn't help much, isolation it's the only way i think :(

so the isolation circuit will be very very very (very very) handy :D
