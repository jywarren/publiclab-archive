Cool!

Does the dusttrack or dylos have a sensor-out port?   I'm thinking we could hook it up to another data logger and collect humidity data on the same time stamp.  I have an [SHT 15 temp and humidity sensor here](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1638) and an [arduino-based datalogger](http://tnhsmith.net/travproj/ArduinoLogger/index.htm) here that writes to an SD card-- if we could get it to read the Dusttrack then you'd be set.  

can you find any info on the Dusttrack's communications protocol or output?
