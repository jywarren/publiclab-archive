Hi [@dcanprdn](/profile/dcanprdn) you're not missing anything, our initial pre-order was so that folks could get in early to start making their own and contributing to the project, and there are other variants of the kit coming soon. That said, we're sorry to hear you're frustrated with what you received! If you would like to drop us a line at kits@publiclab.org, our store manager can work with you to facilitate a return/exchange/unpgrade/etc.
