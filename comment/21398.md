I'm so excited to see this [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie). Love the play on words as always with the naming of the monitor. However, you may want to rename your research note because I thought you actually meant measuring nano-particles for air quality--that would be something! Would you be willing to lend one of your Poorple specials so I can test a fan/HEPA setup?
