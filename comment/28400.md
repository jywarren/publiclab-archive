This info is from Wikipedia, not a quote.  Primary microplastics are smaller particles, such as from microbeads(used on cosmetics, for example).  Secondary microplastics are from the breakdown of larger items, in this case degraded plastic water bottles (the water bottles fall into the category of "macroplastics"). According to Wikipedia, the plastics degrade slowly, in the hundred to thousands of years time frame. Because of this, they are likely to be ingested by animals and enter the food chain.
