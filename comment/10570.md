Hey Matt,

We just had an asbestos scare in my neighbourhood - so I wanted to make some cheap and simple collectors that can be hung up by residents in my area, to gather particle matter, and then analysed to airborne asbestos fibres.

Here is the article that broke with the news on the scare: http://m.heraldsun.com.au/news/special-features/devil-in-the-dust/story-fnl1gf6j-1227086055935?nk=a91292beb970bdc3099f1c3d8278e4f8

Did you ever get anywhere with your sticky tape scanning? If so, please let me know. Thanks.

-Amy-
