Hi, Abhay7417 - can you get the arduino to actually type out the values using the Arduino HID library? https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HID

If so, get it to output values in CSV format, like:

````
0.51,0.11,0.12
````

Where each entry is the intensity value (from 0-1) for a pixel. If you can get it to do that, I'll create a form you can paste it into to save as a spectrum. 

There's some discussion of this buried in this discussion thread: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/plots-spectrometry/7QQ7Yg_0xMw/TJ2kMxtiGAAJ
