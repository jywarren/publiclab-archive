Hi, Ethan - can you demonstrate the variability by taking two scans while pressing vs. not pressing, or pressing differently? That'd be very helpful. 

I also like the idea of a motor oil/diesel blend, or perhaps a dilution study of motor or crude oil. It was great seeing you at the Barnraising, Ethan -- great work so far!
