Another idea for a session -- one on making [great Github issues](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/labels/first-timers-only) -- contributing for non-coders! We've had such success with our `first-timers-only` outreach efforts for PublicLab.org, and we're looking at how similar strategies could be applied to our new activity grids.
