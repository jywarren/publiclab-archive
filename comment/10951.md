Woops I skipped the part at the top where it seems to suggest in advertisement language that the PhotosynQ gives you this and more!

Any chance you could remove the PhotosynQ advert or describe how PhotosynQ addresses all of the salient bits of information about photosynthesis contained in the majority of the note?
