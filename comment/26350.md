Khoroshyy P: I have a 20l aquarium, with some plants. I set it up in the begining of summer. Never changed water. After some month, I inoculated some pond water and some algae and invertebrates. I really don't do anything with it. No feeling no cleaning. But there are plenty of Hydra viridissima on its walls....

But if you want to change water if can be syphoned out... They will survive a couple of minutes on wet walls...
