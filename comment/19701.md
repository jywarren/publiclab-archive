Hi [@silvi_ap51](/profile/silvi_ap51) - I replied on your previous comment. Last night after this question, I went thru upgrading the database on SpectralWorkbench. The database has grown a lot and we're hitting memory issues. I expect it to have improved today. Are you still having issues?
Please try again and continue to report if you have issues. Your reports are super useful: Possibly other users don't bother and then we never learn of problems to fix!
