Oh and the controller (SkyShield plus Nano) should have Velcro loops underneath to match hooks on the top of the frame. I think I included a second Velcro strap to wrap around the whole thing for extra security. That should be plenty. It just sort of hangs out up there but seems to be fine. Let us know if you figure out a better way to attach things.
