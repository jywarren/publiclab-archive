Thanks for bringing this to prominence again. I will attach the code that runs the microprocessor.

<a href="https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/013/original/presslogger.txt"><i class="fa fa-file"></i> presslogger.txt</a> This as mentioned above is writtten in GCBasic ( https://sourceforge.net/p/gcbasic/discussion/ )
