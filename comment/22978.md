There is one part at Thingiverse. Is that the only one you need printed?  
The part at Thingiverse has a flat horizontal lower surface which could cause the print to fail on some printers.  
I would be happy to print five of these for free if all nine of the other Replicators distributed by Public Lab did the same.  
I would also be happy to print 10 of these for free for every one of the abandoned Public Lab Replicators that is shipped to me.
