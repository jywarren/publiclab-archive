Woo!!! rotatable text!!! Wooo!!  I'm doing a happy dance in Portland!

I'm glad you found a manageable way to implement rotational text.  I don't think support for IE 8 is worth any trouble.  People can upgrade, that's a 5+ year old browser 3 versions ago.  It does sound like its worth doing some early-stage browser testing to verify that CSS Transforms works with the browsers before proceeding.
