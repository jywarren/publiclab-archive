 Seems like it would work, except that the force of the water coming out of the machine would destroy the filter material or backflow in an undesirable way.

Check out the RUST manual, toolbox for sustainable cities. They have some schematics for a small greywater treatment system for wash water.

The long and short of it would be that you need to build some kind of surge tank to contain / dissapate the energy of all that water, before running it through a filter.
