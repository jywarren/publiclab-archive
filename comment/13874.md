Hey [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass), more so, I mean modulating the intensity by means of PWM, although there is a temperature wave length correlation in LEDs, example: with increasing voltage obviously increases light intensity, thus increasing internal temperature of the semi-conducting material of the LED does have an effect on wave length fluctuation. This effect is more precise with increasing current rather than voltage, like with an LED drive that has dimmable control.
