A few different cameras were used to take those photos. Most of the cameras were Canon PowerShots. I think all of the photos were saved by the camera as jpegs. Some of the NDVI images were made from photos taken with a camera modified with a Wratten 25 filter. Some were made with a two camera system (see text).
