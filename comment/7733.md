I have been making some progress toward standardized calibration targets. Does anyone viewing this know of a source for inexpensive paints/coatings with a high, diffuse and fairly flat spectral response? The coatings I have used in the past (barium sulfate, halon/teflon) are quite pricey and I don't have easy access to those any more. Some common household paints have published reflectance curves but they tend to be limited to the visible spectrum. That's better than nothing but probably not as good as a recommendation based on experience.
