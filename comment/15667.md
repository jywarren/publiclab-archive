Oh, that's really too bad -- I'm really hopeful that the game "trail camera" we're sending (today!) will help. I don't know how long 8 fresh AA batteries will last in it, but **definitely** longer than a few hours. [This test up in Vermont](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-20-2016/zero-dark-thirsty-capturing-replenishing-nighttime-rain-events-with-a-trail-camera) -- during an all-night rainstorm -- went pretty well, though, so I think we can have much higher confidence in it.
