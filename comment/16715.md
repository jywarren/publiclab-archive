Dear All, 
             As i was going through some literature, i found an interesting paper, "A Mixture of Barium Sulfate and White Paint is a Low-Cost Substitute Reflectance Standard for Spectralon" where Spectralon is an expensive standard reflectance target.  Link for the paper:
" digitalcommons.usu.edu/cpl_techniquesinstruments/11/ "
If this works, it would be a cheaper alternative for Calibration targets.

I look forward to your replies.
