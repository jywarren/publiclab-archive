 You said you've done an FTO, but I should still mention. If you work on anything that changes the look or function of anything on any public lab platform, you'll need to set up a way to run your version of that platform so you can screenshot / video tape the function working so see [this for how to do that](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/3840) Glad I could help :)
