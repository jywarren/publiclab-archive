I believe that if Cindy had pressed Fastie colormap instead of step 3, she would have gotten the same result as Chris's first image -- perhaps a slight variation as the Fastie colormap wasn't an exact copy of the one Chris has in Fiji. This is also what Cindy got after uploading the smaller version.
