Jeff - I think a good way to get a handle on this is to apply a white balance before imaging. Again, assuming that the target you use for white balance is neutral across the wavelengths you are detecting then if you see color variation in the resulting image you are getting more than one band of information. I expect that the colors you are seeing are largely due to a wonky white balance. 

I also want to know the spectral qualities of the cameras we're using so we can calibrate them to measure radiance or at least characterize the signal to get closer to quantitative measurements. I'm working on contacts to help with that.
