[@ggallant](/profile/ggallant) -- Wow, this is fantastic detective work.  Does it seem that you were able to resolve the uC resetting issue with the extra cap parallel with C14?  

I wonder if this would've addressed the [issue](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-19-2016/frozen-riffle) that [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) was having when the Riffle was placed in the freezer?  Perhaps the board was resetting when attempting to write to the SD card and needing extra power, and the cold lithium battery couldn't provide it ... whereas a capacitor (charged more slowly by the battery) could've?  

In any case, seems like a good idea to put 20uF or 100uF at C14?
