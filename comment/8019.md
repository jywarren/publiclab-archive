Hi Pablo, sounds great and your poster looks lovely... regarding your last question, from my experience you need at least 3 hours in good weather conditions to be able to practice building a rig + fly a balloon/kite + download and make a short demonstration of knitting. If you want to do multiple flights and have people actually knit the whole map together during the workshop you have to calculate a lot more time cause the knitting takes the longest time usually. and not everyone like to knit... most people like to fly a ballloon or a kite though :)
