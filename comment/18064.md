Hello! It looks like this is in response to: https://publiclab.org/notes/JSummers/12-02-2014/titraumatic-automated-titration-apparatus

[@jsummers](/profile/jsummers) -- any ideas on this? I wonder if we could also use one of the new cheaper Arduino clones [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) is using to interface the probe with a PC -- an Arduino Nano as in the [#nano-data-logger](/tag/nano-data-logger)
