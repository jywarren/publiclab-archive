your filter switcher looks even less expensive than using a CD player. nice idea. The spinning wheel would permit faster filter switching of multiple filters, but not for $2.
Your solution would also use less power and be lighter.

BTW there is something wrong with the Chinese beamsplitter. Stay away from it.
