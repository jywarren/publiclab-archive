the best software solution would be to wait until the wheel gets up to a consistent speed and then turn the camera on in synch.  That startup phase is the hardest part, but as long as there is consistent hardware latency it will probably be manageable. That said, I think latency will be consistent 99% of the time but that 1% is going to be really problematic.
