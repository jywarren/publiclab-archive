Well, I saw the device and did a patent search for Black & Decker-assigned patents and thermal sensing-- it didn't take too long.  

does their claim to priority apply to a patent filed 3 years later? does it apply if we had an independent process that provides a prior art trail? where does this leave the thermal flashlight and thermal fishing bob? if intended to be used for time lapse photography does that mean that it is a different invention and independent? It would be really interesting to hear some legal opinions.
