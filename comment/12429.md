You should be able to -- the subtraction tools are pretty primitive, though. We're soon (next week?) going to be launching more powerful subtraction tools in the new v2.0 codebase, so stay tuned! You can subscribe to code updates at http://publiclab.org/tag/spectral-workbench and/or on Twitter ([@spectralwb](/profile/spectralwb))
