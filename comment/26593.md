Yes, I am thinking of using Askimet as  a stretch goal but as far as automatic tagging is concerned, It is just a scanning of posts/comments where according to community rules and regulations few words which are unacceptable and spam can be scanned and they can be marked with some tag. 
Suggestion of adding button for filtering can be added where all posts which are marked spam can be selected in bulk moderation. I will surely add it.
I will also add some time for discussions with site user in timeline to get feedback and suggestions. 
Thanks:)
