 Hello everyone!
I'm Govind Jeevan, a CS Student from India.

I'm interested in working on the MapKnitter Image Management project.
But I am not able to understand what is meant by of the listed features
'new templates and APIs to present images on any map, selected by bounding box'
Can someone explain this for me?
