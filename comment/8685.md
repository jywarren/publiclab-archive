Hello Warren. You're right. I wasn't aware. My goal was to build the minimal JS code able to NDVIze the images of the modified webcam: just basic JScript, no rings and bells (tho HTML5).  The idea is to create a generator on a Rasp PI server sending frames captured via V4L2 + jpeglib, and let the client do the image processing.  Again, with the hope to build the minimal engine (avoiding mpegtools, ffxxx, etc) in a tentative to increase the performance,  minimize the footprint as well as the maintenance. Should be a naive LAmP (lower case m, not sure if it is required).
