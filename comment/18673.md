[@warren](/profile/warren) I observed you just need Facebook OAuth before the summer. Another way we could work is divide the entire project into 2 parts. In part-1, I could complete the OAuth integration with google twitter github etc. since that doesn't require that much time and in part-2, I could work on the calendar integration and event work. What do you think?
