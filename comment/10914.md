The stations themselves are not the only hazard : http://www.csb.gov/little-general-store-propane-explosion/  You would be amazed about how lacking safety in the chemical industry. This idea would also be great to map industrial facilities that pose hazards to communities.   Check out http://www.csb.gov/ .
