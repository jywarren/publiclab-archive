I replaced my spectrometer with a Logitec C310 (5MP) webcam with a DVD-R+ section taped over the lens. The 4" magnifying glass was able to focus high pressure sodium street light about 150 yards away onto the lens and get a reading. The process took two people, one to aim the shoebox till the focused dot of light fell on DVD-R+ covered lens and the other person to capture the image. The reading is uncalibrated and not focused at all, but I DO see a spike at around 575nm indicating sodium.
