A L2F is a light to frequency converter. 

This would work for any fluorescing oils such as crude oil. 

To distinguish them you would need to look at emissions at different wavelengths so using different coloured filters. However I think using a spectrograph and looking at the whole spectrum is the most helpful in characterising oils and then use something like this to measure the amount of oil in a sample. However the idea of dispersing the oil with detergent would help in collecting a better fluorescence spectrum from the oil.
