formaldehyde info from the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR)

http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/substances/toxsubstance.asp?toxid=39#12

See Minimum Risk Levels (MRLs), which a lot of these values are based on the same studies but the ATSDR does a good job of citing the studies and factors used.
