I've checked the javascript from the Infragram.org site and could not see any image preprocessing from what was there, the NDVI index was calculated directly from the IR and R channel intensity values, and the colormap was fitted to a range of +1 to -1. 

Still need to figure out where the shift comes from...

In the meantime, I've uploaded an animation showing the results of the Infragram point and shoot taken in a park nearby after a decent rainstorm. I will go back to photograph the same spot once the ground has dried out to see if there are any big differences in the NDVI.
