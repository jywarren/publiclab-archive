**What is microplastic pollution and where does it come from?**
Microplastic pollution is the abundance of tiny plastic particles that are the result of the break down of larger plastic products. In this state the microplastics can be found in bodies of water or even in our own bodies. They are so small that along with many animals, we unintentionally ingest them.
**What is marine plastic pollution like in our area?**
Marine plastic pollution in our area is a huge issue. As a result of commercial fishing and the New Orleans port's traffic, there is a high level of microplastic pollution in the Gulf and in the Mississippi River.
