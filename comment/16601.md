Are you interested in the difference between a blue filter and a red filter? A blue filter could be referred to as NGB (red is blocked and NIR replaces red in RGB). A red filter could be referred to as RGN (blue is blocked and NIR replaces blue in RGB). Ned has a note about why a red filter can be better for vegetation analysis: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi.  Also, blue filters don't seem to work very well with small CMOS sensors which most webcams and small cameras have.
