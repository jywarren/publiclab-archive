A couple neat options if you're interested in winders -- mathew has one of these:

http://publiclab.org/notes/gonzoearth/05-20-2013/heavy-duty-waist-mounted-kite-fishing-winder-from-japan

And [@natevw](/profile/natevw)'s drill winder -- similar to [@gonzoearth](/profile/gonzoearth)'s design too: http://publiclab.org/notes/natevw/5-3-2012/powered-string-winder-balloons

that page also has an upside-down bike winder :-)
