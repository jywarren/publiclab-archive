I guess it's not actually an extra step. When I do the regression I'm comparing the JPEG pixel values that I adjusted with my inverse gamma (un)correction with the reflectance values I got form the spectrometer. The regression established the relationship between those two values and then I can then use the slope and intercept (gain and offset) coefficients from the linear regression to convert the image (after I applied the inverse gamma (un)correction) to reflectance.
