Ah ha! Let's also have some: 
Tyvek tape or 3M construction tape
Kite line and swivels. 
Well illustrated andbook including different kinds of kite shapes/proportions, guidelines as to what flies in different conditions, directory of resources for learning more!
Tyvek cut into extra long strips for use as tail?
