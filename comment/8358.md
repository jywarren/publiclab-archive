It has five holes. The Fritzing diagram was a crude reproduction by me, so it's not likely to be accurate. The Eagle files are from Visualight; they're proper. 

The interest in Visualight was mainly because it has almost everything needed for the board and has already been produced, and has integrated USB... it's pretty nice and very bright. But Don's board is probably cheaper, though perhaps not as bright.
