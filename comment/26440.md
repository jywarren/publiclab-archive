[@warren](/profile/warren) [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) Please have a look  on my proposal and share your views. Also please guide me on accesslint.
[@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) Testing done by axe matchers could do all tests in one go , So would it be appropriate to include testing after each task completion?
Thanks!
