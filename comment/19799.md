[@lach_myers](/profile/lach_myers) You are correct, the interface needs to be displayed through the HDMI lead. Currently the code is still in development so it does need to be run through the python3 IDLE. There's also a lot of library dependencies but IDLE will let you know what needs installing when you run the code.
