yep, ive downloaded this right away when i saw your cool pics. But i dont know how apply it in paint.net or gimp 2.8. ive got many more IR blue and RGB pairs a few minutes ago. 

the gradient tool is hard to understand, in GIMP.

removing the -1 to 0-ish spectrum and replacing it with white/black really helps the picture mean more in the 0 to 0.9 region.
