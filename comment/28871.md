Great point. Would some cheap conductivity work help raise the understanding among more people of the need for $100, more conclusive testing? If so, perhaps some work with two methods from https://publiclab.org/methods#mining , specifically https://publiclab.org/coqui and/or even more coarsely, https://publiclab.org/turbidity
