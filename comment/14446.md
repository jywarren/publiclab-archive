[@warren](/profile/warren), I think that's great. Would there be a place to explain (maybe on the "How to write a research note" wiki) that you can make a unique series name for your experiment (yours alone or a collaborative one), and that would be different from / in addition to e.g. the "spectrometry" tag etc, so it doesn't become a "This is part 63 of 422 in a series on spectrometry"or something too dilute like that?
