Hey [@stevie](/profile/stevie) !
We have a map on https://publiclab.org/people/ which shows the markers of recent contributors only .
Would that map help ? 

Or else we can figure out a way to show all the contributors from the starting of time but that may fill the map completely .

Hope that helps ðŸ˜ƒ !
