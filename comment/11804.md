Surely the most valuable point of Lidar is to provide high resolution data of areas that are inaccessible by other methods. Such as dense vegetation and tree cover. The major issue will be processing power. This is usually provided a stand alone system rather than a flight controller. The amount of data collected is very large, but as usual technology will improve as time moves on and i, like the rest, will be waiting in the wings.
