I am on  both lists, but I sometimes don't thoroughly read it all the way through :( .  I'll go see if I can find it and respond.... we're working really hard on the data storage and analysis component (taking a lot of lessons and pieces from publiclab on that) so any arduino device that can communicate via bluetooth can easily send, store, analyze and share data on the web, so it might be a real benefit to some of these projects.  

Thanks for the ping :)
