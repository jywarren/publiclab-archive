This is super cool! I'd consider taking photos without any filter in the camera-- the [#19](/n/19) Fire will probably not be helpful. UV is the light that penetrates deepest into water, so filtration in the blue/UV region is going to make the image dark.  That's why so many sea creatures can see into the UV.  

Expensive option: Quartz optics would be ideal, there is a RPi camera clone that can take replaceable lenses:
