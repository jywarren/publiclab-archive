These ideas are fantastic. Thanks so much [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n)! I read about this lead screening procedure that uses sodium rhodizonate as a color indicator, as it makes a purple precipitate with lead ([Landes et al. 2019](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00681)). Is that similar to what you're describing above with heavy metal sulfides?

Also, searching online for "DIY heavy metal wet chemical test" turned up this: a [commercial heavy metal detection kit](https://www.chemsee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/datasheet_hm-34k.pdf) meant for detecting poison in food and drinks. Yowza. But I wonder if it would work on soil extracts?

Bring on the weird.
