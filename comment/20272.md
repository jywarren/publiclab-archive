One option may be to use a computer vision system.  Believe it or not its a fairly simple code.  Not sure it would work at night but it could probably switch to counting (moving)  lights if neded.  You need to train a dataset but you could train it to only detect one type of truck (color or size).  Google 'opencv' and 'car tracking' for more examples:
