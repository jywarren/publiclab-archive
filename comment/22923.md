The spectrum won't match.  White LEDs don't produce constant light over the whole visible spectrum, unless you get expensive ones.  There is typically a rather dramatic dip around 500-550 nm. 

Manufacturers of commercial instruments usually have tungsten-halogen lamps which have more constant radiation over the visible range and all kinds of fancy software.  But you pay for it.

Switching the the DIY spectrometer to a tungsten halogen lamp will help, but the software is still behind.
