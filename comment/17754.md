I'm involved with CUSP (Climate & Urban Systems Partnership). http://www.cuspproject.org/ This is a five city initiative, but we connect most often with our home city (Philadelphia for me). Many key organizations and environmental influencers are part of this network, which is geared to climate change. It's local and solution based.
