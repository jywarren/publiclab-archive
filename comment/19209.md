Pollen seems to be around pm10. are you interested in measuring only pollen (yikes! hard!) or generally all particulate matter around that size? Here's a general page about monitoring particulate matter: https://publiclab.org/pm-monitoring that also links to https://publiclab.org/wiki/visual-pm which might be interesting because your lead photo indicates you can see the pollen!
