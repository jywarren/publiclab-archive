A full spectrum camera is one that has been converted to capture NIR by removing the IR cut filter. This filter which is present in all standard cameras blocks NIR so must be removed before the camera can be used to capture NIR.

The basics of this process are described here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/ndvi-plots-ir-kit
