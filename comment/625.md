I finally got the images imported into MapMill so we can all sort and view them online:

http://mapmill.org/images/2012-04-07-massachusetts-somerville-davis-square 

They're also available here: http://archive.publiclaboratory.org/massachusetts/2012-04-07-massachusetts-somerville-davis-square/ 

I've gone ahead and started one in MapKnitter, but haven't yet added any images. As you upload and place images, please lock them so they don't get displaced by people who are just learning to use the tool:
