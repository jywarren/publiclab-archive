[@everydayduffy](/profile/everydayduffy) -For the above comparison I used the calibration option in Pix4D pro. It consisted of drawing a region of interest on the image of the reflectance panel and inputting the known values for given wavelength.
Ned Horning has an excellent plugin used with ImageJ that does a great job using calibration targets with known reflectance values. https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-22-2015/introducing-the-calibration-plugin-for-imagej-fiji
