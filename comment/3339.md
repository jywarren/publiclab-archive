Amazing. Two questions:

* does the distance between the camera and the grating affect focus?
* if we assume that for the design of a compact/useful spectrometer, the "given" value is the distance between the grating and the slit (because we want it to fit, say, in a conduit box) how would we best work backwards to determine the angle? I guess just looking at the chart, but many of our spectrometers have a grating/slit distance of <10 cm.

Wonderful!
