This is fantastic!  I didn't know there were Lego parts that did that sort of height adjustment thing :) 

Your results are really important -- so now we're going to need to think about some way of keeping the sensor a set distance away from a wall, if e.g. we're using the device to 'scan' the inside surfaces of an apartment for thermal leaks.  Maybe a cardboard tube?
