[@warren](/profile/warren) Instead of topic wise sorted question we can use the idea of Favourite tags similar to that used in stackoverflow.

[![favourite_tags.JPG](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/117/large/favourite_tags.JPG)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/117/original/favourite_tags.JPG)

The user can enter a list of favourite tags and the questions will be sorted accordingly. Also we can save this choice and the users can be subscribed to the questions of those tags that way.
