This is really cool! Do you have more information about activities or links to see it in action? If you'd like to connect with Public Lab's Kits Initiative to explore ways to collaborate on community development/distribution, you can find us at kits@publiclab.org, or join us on our weekly Open Calls : https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call . Really looking forward to learning more about this!
