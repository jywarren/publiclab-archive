Sorry about that. By the way, the subtitle of the article is The hardest DIY project ever.
http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2011-07/you-built-what-scanning-electron-microscope
It's beyond my skills, but I'm hoping some engineering students would be interested, and there're a few grants around.
I always wanted my own electron microscope when I was a kid.
