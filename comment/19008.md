1)Check out: 
-	https://opencv.org/
-	Good opencv-install video  : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6RD3X94rEA
2)It looks like Mr Warren may be able to add the image sequencer on the Raspberry PI so you may  have a non-website solution
3)It  still may be worthwhile to use OpenCV for spectra preprocessing.   For example, you could adjust camera integration time/white balance by feedback from analyzed spectra.  The general approach may be to use a masked histogram but there may be  better ways.
