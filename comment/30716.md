**Nitrogen Cycle FADAND:**

1.	Fixation 
Converting gaseous nitrogen into usable forms.

2.	Assimilation
Plants absorbing nitrogen through their roots.

3.	Decomposition
Microorganisms break down organic matter.

4.	Ammonification
The decomposers turn the organic matter into simpler compounds like ammonia.

5.	Nitrification
An aerobic process where nitrifying bacteria convert ammonia into usable forms such as nitrite to nitrate.

6.	Denitrification
An anaerobic process where denitrifying bacteria use nitrogen instead of oxygen, releasing nitrogen gas.
