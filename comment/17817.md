Hi and sorry for the slow reply,  yeah you are right,  indeed I've a more detailed document related with the specifications and performance of my spectrometer,  however it's not in English.. 
At the moment I don't have enough time to  complete it and translate  but I'll try to do it in a couple of months. 
In the meantime. If you have any other general question regarding the spectrometer and its results, I will be glad to answer you!
