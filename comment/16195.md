   Yes, always see the warning about the tags. :(    

   The image is unprocessed, as taken from the camera. I'll try with lower image resolutions.
   I wonder --in my ignorance-- that if I crop the image how can I use the calibration in other spectographs, since will not have the same frame reference. 

Thank you very much!  :)
Javi.
