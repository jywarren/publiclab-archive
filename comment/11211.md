Timestamping would probably be better than versioning because version numbers don't always get used in proper ways. Think of forking a feature branch that is not yet complete and turning it into a new master in a different repository: version didn't get changed yet because the feature branch wasn't yet merged to master. A timestamp should be solid because all changes tend to be timestamped. git would handle this by tracking the entire commit tree for you by tag or commit hash.

Versions could certainly be added along with timestamps. That would help distinguish different forks from the same project being worked on in parallel, the equivalent to git branches.
