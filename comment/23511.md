Hi [@warren](/profile/warren).  
To be honest, I'm not sure what to say regarding this   
It looks friendly and new to me.    
Usually the websites we come across, they start from open sans to roboto, lato and helvetica typefaces.  
It was new seeing a thin font ruling a website.  

I read the link. No wonder it's a humanist sans-serif ðŸ¤”
