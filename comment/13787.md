Yes the Beer-Lambert Law is based on -log(I/Io) but it's applicable for a single wavelength value. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer%E2%80%93Lambert_law) And this law has many limitations. Recent research showed that the area under the peak is much more stable indication of concentration variations (http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jspec/2013/919023/). Hope this is helpful...
