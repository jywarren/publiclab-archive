Hi, [@patcoyle](/profile/patcoyle) - managed (with some help) to get the web-based lens distortion removal system working, and worked out some rough settings for Mobius cameras. Would love it if you gave it a spin -- we could develop presets for the different Mobius lenses, to make this workflow easier!
