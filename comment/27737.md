[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) [@sarasage](/profile/sarasage) The conversation you had in the comments of [this post](https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/02-28-2020/does-anyone-have-experience-assembling-low-cost-voc-kits-using-adafruit-s-voc-sensor) mentioned above was very helpful. Do you happen to have any updates from the field or thoughts on the questions above re: accuracy of lower-cost VOC sensors outdoors?

[@robert_winkler](/profile/robert_winkler) Would you be able to share insights from [MeteoMex](http://www.meteomex.com/drupal/node/3)?

Thanks to all for any thoughts, experiences, or words of wisdom you can share.
