Oh, that's great. I'm glad the comment was useful. 
If you are satisfied with your hand built version, I'd recommend ordering the desktop version. I bought it along with an aperature kit. Since you can monitor the exposure real-time, in Spectral Workbench, you can solve the over-exposure problem that is difficult to solve if you are snapping pictures with a smart phone. 
Last weekend, I got spectra of a 650nm laser pointer, the sunny winter sky, and tap water with different colored drops in it. I haven't figured out what to do with them . . . just trying to figure out the sensitivity and how to read the output. What are you looking to do in the infrared (1100nm)?
