Ned's plugin is available under downloads here: https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin. I still has a bit of a learning curve but offers tremendous power to process lots of images and control many important variables.
I assume Rayleigh scattering is not too much of a problem at low altitudes. Especially if it is not too hazy. But this whole business still needs lots of testing. I have some images from yesterday that I am trying to use to compare Rosco with a dual camera setup. It would be great to have some others testing this out. I will get in touch about sending some Rosco.
