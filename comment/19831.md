Anyone had luck with this web camera?  I tried this method with no luck.  I opened up the slit hole by removing the collimator so there is a huge light source.  But the camera is not seeing even that.

The camera does work fine, but I think there must be some sort of angle issue.

I enlarged the cable hole so that the USB could fit through, and I wonder if the cable is throwing of the angle of the camera.  However, my set up looks like the one above.

Any thought on why I am getting no light on the camera?
