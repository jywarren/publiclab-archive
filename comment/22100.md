 Hi [@harshithpabbati](/profile/harshithpabbati)! thank you! You aren't going to apply as a student as well? You can apply to both but only do one, i believe?

[@rbhatia46](/profile/rbhatia46) also we'd love to have you and anyone else I've missed here. Thank you -- and we'd love some help making more `first-timers-only` issues as well, actually, because there are lots of new people showing up! Thanks!!
