hi sara - we haven't yet started working on map knitter, my main questions just now just have to do with first steps - how to find the base map image on which to 
layer our images; if we can/should connect them to the maps already completed in lima; and if there is a way to work/knit offline (which will be more pressing once 
we leave lima and head for the provinces)? if you have time for a quick sykpe, i'm at 'wrongrrl' there. and thanks for the feedback! xoxo
