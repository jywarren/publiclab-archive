Hi, thanks for reporting. For the first and second, did you have the "vertical" checkbox checked? Perhaps for one but not the other?

For the calibration itself, you need to choose a cross section that intersects the spectrum at your desired height. Then there will be a marker for cross section on the image. As it is now, it's sampling the *top* row of pixels. I'm going to create a feature request that for vertical images, it uses the **middle** row of pixels. That may work better for folks using a foldable spectrometer:
