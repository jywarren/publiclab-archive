Really wonderful writeup.  the SHT11, 15, and 21 are all sensors that we're looking to deploy and its good to see an initial look at their precision.  

I also want to complement the way you broke down your arduino sketch to highlight what different sections are doing; that is very helpful. really good integration of natural and machine language.
