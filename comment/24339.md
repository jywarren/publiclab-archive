 Density is difficult to use. Many manufacturers use fillers like titanium dioxide as a filler.  This will dramatically alter the density, depending on the amount added.  As for the burn test, yes this works.  It is a variation on the pyrolysis method mentioned earlier.  Something like polystyrene burns with a Smokey flame, while polyethylene burns with a much cleaner flame.  Again, the additives can dramatically change this.  By identifying the pyrolysis by FTIR, you can get an idea of what you are looking at.  Pyrolysis is more often used with elastomers than plastics. But hot press can often be used with plastics.
