I assume y'all are talking to center for biological diversity and looking for nurdles in the rivers?  it may not be enough for a lawsuit, but searching for plastics in the water can be educational, and help build allies.  

think about partnering with a local watershed group to search for nurdles.  if you find any, reach out to other water groups, maybe even NY aquarium on Coney Island?

Air impacts to you are water pollution impacts to potential allies downstream.  also, you could get outside in a relatively safe way--nurdles aren't as dangerous as ethylene oxide.
