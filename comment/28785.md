I wanted to say that I really appreciated how you adapted and refined your proposal based on our input and to assure you that your work looks really promising, and your collaborative skills are especially appreciated. We aren't able to work with as many people as we'd like to each year and we encourage you to apply again in the next cycle. Thank you so much for your contributions!
