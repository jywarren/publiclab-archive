I wonder if this is something [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet)'s library could help with. Have they posted their data somewhere? I know they can share it via Weather Underground, and maybe [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) can have it appear as a layer alongside weather and other toxic release and report/alert data in his new library?
