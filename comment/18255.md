The cost of all of them actually vary a lot.  We took a 40x apart at the barnraising and realized it only has two lenses inside of it, which seemed strange, but it still works.  We weren't able to get the high right on the 10x to actually see anything, which seems weird and is a thing worth troubleshooting.   I don't think it will work as-is if we just hook up a 10x on the current setup
