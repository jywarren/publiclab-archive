Hi
I had wrong white balance for my camera.
Thanks everyone for the help.
Sorry for the trouble
If anyone has any idea on how to save pictures taken with wrong white balance I have quite a few I'd like to save. 
However from now on, of course, I'll use correct white balance.
Thanks
Best regards,
Rita
