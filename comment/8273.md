Thanks Jack for your response, is not too much trouble, if you could send me the circuit diagram to my email? Please, If you need help, tell me to improve your board. I have also the launchpad stellaris and have ADC 16 bits converter and TL072/TL084CN as operational amplifier (this integer work to made a pH meter with arduino).
