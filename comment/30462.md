Interdependency is other living organisms that depend on some other organism for life.  

Biome: specific ecosystems whereby all the organisms' function, live, and thrive in a special set environment. The environment in a biome is conducive to a life and function of organisms that inhabit it.  

Hydrosphere deals with marine biome. 

The marine biome, which consists of salt water is the largest biome on Earth? How much drinkable water do have left? Marine plants provide more than half of the oxygen on earth. The freshwater biome is filled with low level of salt. (Three main types of freshwaters: ponds and lake, streams and rivers, and wetlands).  

The current world population is 7,969,216,500. 

The amount of people with no safe drinking water is 779,744,071. 

Only three percent of the earths water is drinkable. There is about 71 percent with water in the hydrosphere. The atmosphere includes 78 percent nitrogon and 21 percent oxygen.
