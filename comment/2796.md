So i refocused it, this was the most recent calibration, the red and green channels are producing very clear and crisp peaks and valleys, however, the blue channel is still very fuzzy. Is this just unavoidable because of the camera? most recent calibration: https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/2136

Thanks, definitely an improvement
