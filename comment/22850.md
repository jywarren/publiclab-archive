Metals usually take instruments like atomic absorption (AA) or inductively coupled plasma (ICP).  These instruments can NOT be done easily on the PL labs spectrometer.

For example, for mercury, you need the AA, a cold vapor aparatus, and a mercury hollow cathode lamp tuned to 254 nm.  The last AA I bought was about $30k.  It was middle of the road.  This was about 2000.  

Sorry to say,  I think you need another approach for metals like mercury.
