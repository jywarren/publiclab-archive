Ok.  There are two easy aircraft tracking systems, ADSB and UAB.  ADSB is commonly used on aircraft flying above 10,000 ft.  UAB is more often used by lower flying aircraft.  These both use a " dongle" available in the $20 price range.  Or you can get dongle specifically designed for these applications, but the cost will be more.  

Myself, I would try the $20 dongle first.  While it does take a computer ( as do the others) it also allows you to listen to air traffic frequencies.  This may also give you some of the information you need.  

A good starting point is rtl-sdr.com .  It will give a get started guide as well as plenty of articles an new applications for the dongles.  

Good luck.
