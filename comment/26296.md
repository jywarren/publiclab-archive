My expertise is chemistry.  But in working in a glp/gmp lab  environmenment, I was trained in some of it.

The major concern with HEPA filters was eliminating bacterial contamination.  Initially, bacteria were thought to be no larger than 0.5 um. A few years later, some bacteria were found that were 0.3 um in size, which led to the reduction in filter size. 

But to try and take that further is really pushing it.  There would need to be A lot of work proving these filters could capture nanoparticles before it would be acceptable.  When you are talking about the FDA (all the validations and other steps required), realize what is involved both in time and money.

Good luck.
