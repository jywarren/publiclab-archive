**Bioassays?**

This uses biological (living) organisms, like plants or animals, to measure toxicity in a test sample. For example, soil contaminants can affect an organism’s growth in a predictable way, so measuring and comparing growth in organisms exposed to different samples can indicate the presence of toxic compounds.

I’ve found some resources on this topic and will start collecting them on a [wiki page here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/bioassay). This [Environmental Inquiry page](http://ei.cornell.edu/toxicology/bioassays/Uses.html) is a great place to start for now.
