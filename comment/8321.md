Nice work you guys!! Was the plant running on the day that this image was taken? Since the plant has been going up and down recently It might be interesting to correlate the satellite image/s with the plant's uptimes & downtimes and see if we can find out how long the thermal difference persists and whether it's stronger when the plant runs continuously for longer periods of time.
