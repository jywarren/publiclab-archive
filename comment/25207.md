Hello! I'm also in NYC and would love to connect. [@bronwen](/profile/bronwen) and I work out of the New Lab at the Navy Yards, be happy to have you swing by anytime. Also, we have an open call every Tuesday at 3pm ET on Zoom here https://zoom.us/j/934187763 and we take notes in this pad: https://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall -- any chance that time works for one or some of you to stop in virtually and say hello?
