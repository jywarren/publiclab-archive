I wonder if we can make these in a really DIY fashion where you just print
 out the color wheel and mark it up by hand with the temperature range that
you are investigating...since the temperature range of interest will 
vary?

Also can we figure out a way to reverse read the thermal paintings so we can reasssign temperature values in case people want to quantify their thermal painting?
