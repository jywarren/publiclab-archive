Forager bees work only 1 species of flower on any single flight, so when you collect individual pollen packets from returning forages they are monospecies. 
We will be collecting micrographs and DNA barcoding samples that have spectrographic data. This way we can positively assign species identifications to spectrographic fingerprints. 
BTW PCR and ELISA are both very different tests and ELISA wouldn't be of any help here.
