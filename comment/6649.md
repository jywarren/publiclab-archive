Chris, that's interesting.  That patch is significantly less blue that the training patch.  I wonder why.  Maybe different specularity?  From your EXIF data and <a href="http://www.susdesign.com/sunangle/">this website </a> I can get the angle of the sun.  Do you know how figure the orientation of the camera?
