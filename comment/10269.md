[@JSummers](/profile/JSummers) was commenting that the light path on my gel caps was never going to be [consistent enough to compare to the laser peak.](http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/09-12-2014/fluorescence-spectroscopy-with-the-foldup-gelcap#c10265)  this seems to be a case of similar.  How important is it to have a consistant relationship between the laser and the slit to normalize the laser peaks?
