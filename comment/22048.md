 Hi [@IshaGupta18](/profile/IshaGupta18) ! Very nice and complete proposal, congratulations! Depending on what happens, I would be glad to help you out as a mentor. The part of adding a Browsable Time Slider is very cool. About what [@warren](/profile/warren) said, I believe making it a pure JS library might be interesting because of the potential reusability, perhaps integrating it with Image Sequencer, the Editor and others in the future. As you mentioned, it might be a quite heavy task, but as far as I know currently we don't have much trouble with excessive load on client-side. If it happens, we can always move it to the server-side with few changes. That said, I think both implementations can be equally successful. Thanks!
