The raw spectra these DIY devices produce are not absolute calibrated per-color, so they may be more sensitive to blue than red. You could either independently confirm the ratio of red/blue using an absolute method, or use a known light source to absolute-calibrate your camera. There's some about this process here: [#gain-correction](/tag/gain-correction) -- but it's not so easy to follow, and it'd be great to get a clearer guide published sometime.
