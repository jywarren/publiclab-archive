 Hey, congratulations! I see we have project similarity and also the spreadsheet is some great work!
I agree that adding opencv entirely is heavy and would cause duplicacy for many of our modules! I have the opencv addition to our nodejs project as the approach but am open to new options which are better.
Also I would like to inform that I am pre-occupied with my semester exams till 22May as I mentioned in my proposal. I would love to share new ideas and work together to add the best approach. Thanks
