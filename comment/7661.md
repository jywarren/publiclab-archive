Ned, I followed your advice and now have processed my first dual camera images (RGB and 850nm IR) using your PhotoMonitoring plugin, which works like a charm. Unformunately, I cannot post images in the comments, because I have a question about the color schemes of your PhotoMonitoring plugin. It looks (to me) that the color scales of both NDVI and NRG are inverted. Green vegetation is bluish in the NRG and bare soil is more red. I will take some more images and investigate further when it ever stops raining. The second thing I am wondering about is which channel is best to use for IR, i.e. which of the RGB channels is most sensitive to IR.  I assume this depends on the sensor. Sometimes there are more green pixels. However, red seems to be most logical - or?
Thanks again in advance,
Thorsten
PS: there is no metadata-extractor-2.6.2.zip in the download folder on github, just the jar file. Hence, xmpcore.jar is missing.
