Thanks guys. Really helpful responses. Looks like Pi Noir camera v2 is my best bet at the moment. 
For the lighting I'll be using a set of full spectrum LED grow lights (PPFD: >130 Âµmol/m2/s at 15cm). 
I'd be glad to share my experience as I progress. Recommendations are highly welcomed.

Cheers
