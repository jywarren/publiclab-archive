x) Thanks warren! I sincerely don't know anything about their API but that would be awesome!
Archive lets also add extra metadata so I think GPS tagging would be possible as well to help Mapknitter to position the composites. 

By the way tomorrow I'll give the first try to a kapfoil arrived yesterday. Still virgin with mapknitter but not for so long ;D
