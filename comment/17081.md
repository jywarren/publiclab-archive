[@shantler](/profile/shantler) I'm probably missing something, but the battery shown in the link in the components list doesn't look like the battery in the pictures above.  Is it possible that the battery you are using is actually this [battery from DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-489.html) ?
