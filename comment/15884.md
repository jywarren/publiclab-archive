Hi amir,

I have modified the webcam by removing the ir filter from it, I have IR Pass filter which i can use with it. Can you give me step by step procedure how to capture the photos of different objects on one background using the spectrometer. I have seen the DIY spectrometry kit and I can make the spectrometer
