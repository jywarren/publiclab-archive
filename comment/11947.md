Hi, Don - [@mathew](/profile/mathew) and I spent a week and got some drivers written, including for the Shinyei -- how much would it be to order a few of these boards, pre-stuffed? Since we've used the standard Firmata program for Arduino, it should work out of the box, I believe. Although, there seems to be some kind of Firmata-similar code out there for the DigiSpark, too... i didn't look enough into it, though.
