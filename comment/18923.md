Great question, [@csteran](/profile/csteran) -- just for a few clarifications, do you need to do it a) without internet access, or do you want to b) have it produce NDVI whenever an image is taken, with no browser-based tweaking?

For reference, how are you currently triggering it to take a picture? Would we be able to run a script after the image is taken? If so, i think we have a way forward on this!
