Nice! 

> ChemSee's H2S-KT1 contains two hydrogen sulfide dosimeters, FULL USE INSTRUCTIONS and in-lab analysis by ChemSee. Together, these two items allow for rapid, quantitative analysis of air for the presence of hydrogen sulfide.
> 
> Just mail the exposed hydrogen sulfide dosimeter(s) in a sealed envelope to:

> **ChemSee / Appealing Products, Inc.**

> ChemSeeâ€™s Dosimeter: Hydrogen Sulfide detects hydrogen sulfide, H2S, in the range of 0 to 5 ppm * hr. To determine the total exposure of the indicator to H2S, compare the color formed during testing to those provided on the dosimeter. Divide the ppm * hr value on the card by the total exposure time to determine the average amount of H2S is the air during the trial period.
