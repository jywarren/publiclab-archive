Biodiversity is important because it is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including humans.  I say biodiversity is important because Biodiversity ensures health and food security. Biodiversity underpins global nutrition and food security; Biodiversity helps fight disease. Higher rates of biodiversity have been linked to an increase in human health. Biodiversity benefits business. Biodiversity provides livelihoods. Biodiversity protects us. Biodiversity deals with plants and animals. Biodiversity- The more diverse, the more populated the species are... Meaning that there are more. Biodiverse is dropping everywhere.
