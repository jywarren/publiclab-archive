I've been using my kite and little putt-putt boat in [Sweetwater Pond](http://www.hookandbullet.com/googlemap.aspx?lat=29.3305015563965&lon=-90.7009201049805) to count cordgrass and cattail though I'm probably doing it wrong. The boat launches from about anywhere and is very quiet. We see egrets, big redfish too. 

Excellent work Scott.
