Hi, I'm not sure why scans [#2](/n/2) and [#5](/n/5) came out so much rounder than the rest of the spectra. I think it has to do either with the angle of the spectrometer with the cuvette holder or with the flexure of the housing. I've noticed that both of these variables can effect the shape of a spectrum.

The cuvette cover-flap doesn't stay folded over the cuvette on its own, so I always press it down with my finger when I am capturing a spectrum. I think that the force from my fingers might be the cause of some variability. I would prefer it if i didn't have to be touching the spectrometer while capturing spectra.

I took 2 more scans of the diesel sample today and they both seemed to segregate with the majority of my  scans from 10/28.
