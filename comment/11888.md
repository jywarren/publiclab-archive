I ran [a test](http://publiclab.org/notes/nshapiro/11-03-2014/diy-formaldehyde-test-kit#c11886) in our kit packing area and found 26ppb of formaldehyde.  while running the test, a Rotameter from VWR arrived in the mail.  I hooked it up in line with the graduated cylinder and it read .25L/m, and my 200ml draw of air through the graduated cylinder took 40.33, 40.38, and 40.62 seconds on the three tests I ran. So, both methods are not in agreement. one says i'm getting .25L/m and the other .3L/m.

[@danbeavers](/profile/danbeavers) We ordered 20 tubes here at the office and they didn't come with anything like a tip breaker.  I have a triangle file though. I drilled a 7/64" hole into a piece of brass tubing to make a tip breaker.  It worked much better than pliers, and all the glass pieces are contained by the tube, but still left a nasty rough edge.  I'll try adding a score with a triangle file to the next tube I break.
