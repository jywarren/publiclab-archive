Thanks for the suggestion Bronwen! I cross-posted there and here are some of the responses:

Delta M:  I regularly have Hydra in my fish tanks. They come with wild caught live food from nearby ponds and steel the food from my fishes. Several species reproducing in large numbers as long as they can catch living Daphnia or Cyclops.
They don't care about the tap water I use for water changing weekly around 90%. To break down the population it takes several weeks without live food.
