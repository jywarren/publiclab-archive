I totally agree that uplifting imagery is a great way for amplification and awareness of this issue.  

Could your group link up with other local/regional groups to combine amplification efforts?  Other community orgs in adjacent spaces may have larger audiences to push this in front of new eyes.

One further organizing strategy could be to use this opportunity to pen an op-ed or other public facing explanation/advocacy call.  I'm happy to help think through ways to pitch this to local and/or regional news outlets that could help expose this more publicly. Never underestimate the power of publicly shaming institutions/gov agencies into action.
