Most spectra mismatches occur because of the light source.  So, say you are trying to get the spectra of holmium oxide glass ( a common standard).  That goes between the light source and the spectrometer.  With common white led sources, since they dont provide light over the entire visible spectrum, there will be problems.  

On the other hand, a tungsten lamp will provide relatively uniform light over the entire visible spectrum.  So there will no problem acquiring data.

This doesnt eliminate problems with different scales.  Different scales are used by different instruments ( absorbance, trsnsmittsnce, and a few less often used). These can drastically affect how a spectrum looks.

Hopefully, this helps.
