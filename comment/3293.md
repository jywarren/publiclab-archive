Hi, Ernest - what kind of sample is it? A water sample? Where did it come from?

What do you suspect it contains and why? 

Our community's spectrometric techniques are very young, more like prototypes. But we will help you if we can. Perhaps we can have it analyzed at a "real" lab as well, especially if you are worried about urgent health issues.

Also, where did you get those sample bags?
