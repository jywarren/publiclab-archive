You are correct that this is not really an extraction. It's just plant material chopped up finely in a blender with some liquid. I also did this with spinach leaves (https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/3-16-2013/par) in pure water and got interesting transmission (absorption) results. So apparently you don't really need to extract the pigments to determine their approximate spectral characteristics. The blender probably ruptures enough cells that some of the pigments go into the solution, but most of the liquid is more likely a suspension of tiny pieces of plant tissue. It will be interesting to learn if you get different results when you use a solvent that does a better job releasing the pigments into solution.
