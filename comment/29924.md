Caleb Hall- 4/5/2022-
 Today in Mr. Phillips' Environmental Science class, me and two other classmates were grouped up and tasked with creating a poster based on a topic of our choice. My choice chose to do our poster on biodiversity, and we got to work on creating a poster with illustrations and facts about biodiversity.
