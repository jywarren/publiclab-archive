Pat, we have an option to have different lenses installed at the factory. They are asking for a sample lens, and specs on what we'd want to have installed for custom cameras we could offer through the Public Lab store.

I am looking at 8mm M12 lenses online, but thought I'd ask you directly: if you could have any (low-cost) lens preinstalled on a Mobius, which would you pick? If you can send me a link to a product, I can try to get it made in bulk.

Anyone have thoughts on this?
