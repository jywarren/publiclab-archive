[@warren](/profile/warren) I am positive of doing a considerable amount of progress on Mapknitter before the summer begins. Ideally I should finish the Mapknitter upgrade atleast 2-3 weeks ahead of schedule. So I can upgrade Spectral Workbench after that. Even if that doesn't happen, I'd love to work on the Spectral Workbench upgrade after the GSoC period is over! ðŸ˜ƒ
