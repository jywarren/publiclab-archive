I keep my eye out for old Nalgene bottles which are tough enough to survive rough handling and hydraulic pressure. The lids are also strong so they can be tightened securely and a hull penetrator will work well:

There are a few of these hull penetrators still available at the KAPtery:  http://kaptery.com/product/hull-penetrator  
And these look like a good deal:  https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/parts/penetrator-10-25-a/

For outdoor deployment on land where rising water will not threaten the enclosure, I have been using plastic peanut butter jars. The lids are not that strong, but hull penetrators work well on the nice flat top. See Figure 8 here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/03-10-2018/installing-the-water-level-monitor

If the peanut butter jar is protected or under cover, a hull penetrator might not be needed.
