Great questions. I do think [@stoft](/profile/stoft) is mostly interested in intensity stability for the moment but both are good questions. 

I'm interested in whether the stability of the solux is unique or if all incandescent bulbs are that stable. Or if the 12v power source [@stoft](/profile/stoft) is using is relevant.
