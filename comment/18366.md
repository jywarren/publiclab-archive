Thanks That's a lot of good information, now for hands on river work that design works pretty well , I was more working toward collect and then test back in the lab. I expect to get the price down farther to $10 after finding a cheaper light source and the 3d printed frames are .75 each. The research note will help alot on the programming.

Nano --> 2.20
Sensor-->3.50
Laser-->2.00
Frame-->.75
Total -- $8.45 Finished and working
