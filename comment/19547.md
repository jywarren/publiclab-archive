Hi, I don't think this export was affected by yeterday's outage. The interrupted exports were for other users [@justinhall74](/profile/justinhall74) and [@whallet](/profile/whallet) - I sent individual comments on each case. [@warren](/profile/warren) I guess [@Zemans](/profile/Zemans) should try again? Here is a link to his try in case someone can tell what happened: https://mapknitter.org/maps/test-boys - [@Zemans](/profile/Zemans), thanks for letting us know and sorry you had difficulties!
