Andres,
I think when you do some things to a spectrum, like re-extract, rotate image, or set sample line, the calibration is reset to null. So it might be that you just have to calibrate again.  

There might be more knowledgeable people paying attention at the plots-spectrometry Google Group than to research notes (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/plots-spectrometry">this link might get you there</a>).  There should probably be a link to the group at Spectral Workbench.
