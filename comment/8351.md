That is great. It's just like a double beam spectrophotometer. Any chance to post some results. For example a 10mg sodium nitrate aqueous solution, shine laser and get whole spectra including UV-visible. The 10mg/L nitrate concentration in water(mainly groundwater) would give "baby blue" symptoms to children. Is so incredible to see all these improvements in such a short time by people actions.
