Pat,
I just did a fresh install of Firefox on Windows 7. When I clicked the embedded Photosynth, it wanted me to "activate" Silverlight. I clicked OK and it took a few seconds and then loaded and displayed the panorama properly. The embeds also display correctly in Internet Explorer. They do not display properly in Chrome in Windows, but they do display.
