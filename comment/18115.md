There may also be some mis-auto-focusing by the smartphone camera. Over-exposure too, but also try getting the focus to lock on the more detailed lines of the spectrum and your crispness may improve a bit. 

Looks like a good build, though! Glad to hear it was pretty easy and thanks for the feedback and troubleshooting!
