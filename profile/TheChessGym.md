# TheChessGym

I am Mr. Rene' Warren Phillips of the St. John the Baptist Parish School District STEM PROGRAM. I have a Masters Degree in Education, an undergraduate Degree in Christian Education, and presently pursuing a Doctorate in Theological Studies at Dallas Theological Seminary. I teach subjects ranging from Fine Arts Survey to ACT Prep 1 & 2. I am interested in and committed to learning and preserving a healthy environment in our world. Environmental Science is not just a subject of interest to me, it is also a personal responsibility to which I hold in high regard.
