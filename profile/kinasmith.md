###I am human.

I am a human who is currently marginally employed in Fairbanks, Alaska. I get paid by the University of Alaska sometimes for environmental sensor development work and I am also involved with a local Co-Working space and bike share startup. I do lots of Alaska things too, but spend a lot of time in windowless basements tinkering with electronics and digital fabrication tools. 

I am a graduate from the [Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp), and building things is an important part of my identity. 

I'm on [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/member/kinasmith/) and [Github](https://github.com/kinasmith/).
