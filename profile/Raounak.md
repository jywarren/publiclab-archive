Developer | Mentor | Speaker
A passionate software developer who uses Ruby to express in code is what defines me.

I am in the field of Web-development form past 3 years and I am loving it. Currently, I am a pursuing my undergraduation in Computer Science and working as a software developer in a company(Namyata). I provide services in Web-development and DevOps. When I am not coding you will probably find me on a football field.
