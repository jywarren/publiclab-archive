How it works ? 
This question was the reason to choose Science (Mathematics) at School and Computer Science and Engineering at Graduation. I am eagerly wants to learn new things and technologies, also to implement my technical skills to solve real life problems.While making any solution or while working on any project if any technology or tools comes in my path then I always learn those tools or technologies and implement them. 

My hunger to learn and easily adoption of any tools and technologies makes me unique.
