I am a Delhite currently pursuing Computer Science from IIIT Delhi. Iâ€™m interested in using data-driven techniques to build intuitive, intelligent systems, especially Technology for Social Good.
My research interests lie (broadly) in fields of data mining, big data analytics, machine learning, spatial data mining and distributed systems.

Apart from academics, I am a former national level football player and am quite passionate about powerlifting and general sports strength.
