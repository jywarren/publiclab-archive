Lives in Auckland, New Zealand.
Architect by profession; on a journey with open-source electronics and code; love this earth - hate people trashing it.
I teach a group of 20+ children, aged 10-13 years old, called "AKL Mini-Makers" (est. 2015) https://www.facebook.com/groups/1178513745499562/ , we're partnered with Auckland Council and AUT. 
Someday, maybe, one of these kids will save the world.
A keen Maker, I also enjoy developing prototypes with the tutors.
My interests are: Drones; Aerial mapping; Systems for monitoring natural environment; Low-cost, adaptable, open-source, building management systems (BMS) for green buildings - Something you control that cannot sell your data to third parties.
