# SuziT9

I am a communications and outreach specialist at Montana State University, where I am involved in projects supported by NASA, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and other agencies. I have helped develop outreach strategies and products for topics like astrobiology, nanotechnology and climate change. I am also the co-leader of the Montana Girls STEM Collaborative, a statewide network dedicated to inspiring and encouraging girls to consider careers in STEM.
