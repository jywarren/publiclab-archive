I am a mechanical engineering senior at UMass Amherst who has become involved with embedded micro-controller applications in environmental monitoring. As part of a team from A Natural Resources & Conservation class, we are building a submersible ROV that will be used to study water conditions that may predict cyannobacteria "algae" blooms as well as various habitat studies in fish ecology.
