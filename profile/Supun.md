# Supun

A simple person with a complicated curiosity. Trying to drive concepts from early stage research to polished final product and believes that creativity makes life an intense experience. I'm currently Software Engineering undergraduate at University of Westminster. I have worked as a Software and Web Developer from 2012, and also experienced in Database Systems and Mobile App development. I have successfully completed GSoC 2016 with Moodle, 2017 Joomla and I have been involved with many open-source projects developments as well.
