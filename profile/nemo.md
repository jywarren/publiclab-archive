Stefan Unterhauser is a gardener of servers, and has cultivated Public Lab's web services as if they were his own precious garden for several years. He is a ninja guerilla sysadmin who, if he were a real gardener, would break into corporate lobbies in the dead of night to water and fertilize their potted plants, as well as plant a few of his own delicious tomato plants without anyone noticing.

<h3>The SysAdmin Barnstar</h3>
This barnstar honors those who keep the Public Lab servers going through natural disasters, enemy attacks, slashdotting, and people tripping over cables. <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/people/nemo">Dogi</a> is the first ever recipient of this barnstar, which was awarded by <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/people/liz">Liz</a> on November 3, 2012.
