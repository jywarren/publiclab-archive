Hey everyone at Public Lab. I'm Stewart and I live and work in London. I'm highly interested in waste removal techniques and services since I started working for London <a href="http://www.rubbishplease.co.uk/">rubbish removal company Rubbish Please</a> . I hope in Public lab i will become part of this great community which will help me learn more about the environmental and health challenges that the Earth is facing as I'm very motivated to fight waste pollution.
