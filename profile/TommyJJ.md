# TommyJJ

Born and raised in London. Living an ordinary and happy life. Had an amateur passion for photography! Trying to produce zero-waste and live green. Recently more and more interested in recycling and reducing or reusing everyday household items. Working for a <a href="http://www.tomsjunkcollectors.co.uk/">rubbish removal company</a>, based in London, because contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment makes me happy.
