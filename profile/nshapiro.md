I am an incoming assistant professor of biology and society at UCLA and a fellow at the Technoscience Research Unit at the University of Toronto. 

For my doctoral work at Oxford, I tracked the quasi-legal resale of 150,000 chemically contaminated emergency housing units (FEMA trailers) as they were resold across the country using a medley of ethnography, analytically chemistry and GIS mapping. During my post-doc at Goldsmiths, University of London, I helped to develop a participatory design project aimed at monitoring the air quality impacts of unconventional natural gas extraction in northeastern PA. He moonlights as a woodworker.
