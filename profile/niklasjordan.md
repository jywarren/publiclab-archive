# niklasjordan

At the day I am a User Experience Architect for organizations that do good. But at night I am an technologist with focus on environmental issues and science nerd. I also give many talks at conferences on user experience, sustainable technologies and the planet friendly web.

I am interested in water, climate change, geophysics, oceanography, air pollution, open data and social/environmental justice.

My toolbox includes different Arduino microcontrollers, many sensors and sweets. I have already participated in several Citizen Science Projects and member of our local FabLab.
