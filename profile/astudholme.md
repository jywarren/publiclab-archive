My aim as a graduate student and beyond is to contribute to the development of more stable, sustainable and resilient socio-ecological systems. Given my training as a biologist, I am interested in the roles green space and green infrastructure play within urban environments and how we interact with and within these spaces. Specifically, I would like to explore how these spaces contribute to the biodiversity of the urban ecosystem, how citizen science can be a valuable way in which residents interact with these spaces and how policy can support the development of both. My experience developing environmental education programs and being a citizen scientist has exposed me to the role citizen science can play in not only fostering pro-environmental behaviors but also in facilitating a much-needed dialogue between citizens and scientists.
