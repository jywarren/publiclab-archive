I currently work with Louisiana communities as the Research Analyst with the environmental health and justice non-profit, Louisiana Bucket Brigade. I support community based participatory research by utilizing our DIY tools, the "bucket", and iWitness Pollution Map. 

The EPA-approved "bucket" is a simple, community friendly tool that fenceline neighbors use to take air samples. The iWitness Pollution Map is an online map developed by the Louisiana Bucket Brigade that crowdsources eyewitness reports of petrochemical accidents in the Gulf region.  Residents impacted by petrochemical disasters can call, text, email or submit a report online to the map providing real time accounts, including photos and videos, on a range of impacts including odors, spills, explosions and health effects. Check out the iWitness Pollution Map (map.labucketbrigade.org), a cutting edge community based participatory research tool which utilizes the Ushahidi platform. 

I joined Public Lab around the 2013 Barnraising, looking further my understanding of Public Lab's tools such as the spectrometer. I am excited to work with everyone in the Public Lab community in our work to legitimize community based science around the world!
