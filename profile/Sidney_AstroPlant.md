I'm Sidney and I'm working with a great team (AstroPlant) on a citizen science project for the next generation of space farmers. This embodies building hydroponics growkits with the purpose of deploying them at various locations including schools to measure and analyze heterogeneous environmental conditions in which the plants grow.
