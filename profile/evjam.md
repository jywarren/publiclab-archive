Eager to research or implicate a design into the system to establish and highlight the key problems our atmosphere faces from the pin point. 
A system which gets to the bottom of it, showing up cause from the source, and encourages each and every user or onlooker to take a different approach, or at least is at an advantage to be able to change their environmental positioning. 
PublicLab seemed an appropriate place to begin, initial contact, spread-the-word, to affiliate following, inspire and get inspired..
