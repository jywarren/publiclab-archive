Hello, 
My name is Orion Allgaier and I'm currently an undergraduate in the Environmental Public Health program at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire.  I hold expertise in data collection, risk assessment, ambient air quality, and public relations through work in the Public Health Sand Mining Project, a non-profit research group here on campus.  
I look forward to collaborating with you all!
