Developing recombinant enzymes and proteins for analytical testing of water, soil, plants, foods, and more.  Co-developed an open-source handheld dual wavelength photometer with Dr. Pearce's team at Michigan Technological University to measure nitrate and phosphate in environmental samples.  Enzymes are a more environmentally benign choice in comparison to other methods utilizing toxic chemicals and provide accurate reliable data for both in the lab and out in the field.
