My work focuses on the biological, technical and industrial challenges to sustaining global biodiversity, ecological and evolutionary processes underpinning viable populations of terrestrial and marine wildlife.  Interactions between the built environment and ecological systems; ecological impacts from energy production, transportation, skyscrapers, food production, invasive species, telecommunications and climate change; ecological risk modeling, scientific software, earth imaging and remote sensing applied to global and local ecology.
