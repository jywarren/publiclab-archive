Hi! My name is Ron Huber. I am  executive director of Friends of Penobscot Bay. This is the bay that separates "Downeast Maine" from "Midcoast Maine" & "Southern Maine". It is the center of Maine's lobster industry and, thanks to the removal of two dams, its Penobscot River and upper bay are regaining the runs of sturgeon, river herring, salmon and their prey and predators..  

I am interested in Public Laboratory as a means to (1) gain the skills and tools to better discover the identity and quantity of the legacy wastes afflicting Stockton Harbor  in the upper bay. (2) Get to know others  interested in deciphering our bays many wastes. and otherwise helping Penobscot Bay and River recover from the industrial excesses of the 19th and 20th centuries.
