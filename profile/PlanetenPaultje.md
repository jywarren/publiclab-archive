# PlanetenPaultje

I am a volunteer at the Orion Planetarium of The Netherlands http://www.volkssterrenwachtorion.nl where I do lectures and (physics) demonstrations for the general public visiting the observatory. My interest in spectrometry comes from general physics, meteorology and astronomy.
I am also interested in applying iOS devices in science education.
