Charlotte Clarke just joined the Public Lab team as a part of the Oil & Gas Water Fellowship Trio, specifically focusing on researching oil & gas water monitoring methods.

She is from Massachusetts and graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in Environmental Engineering in 2017. She now lives in New Orleans and manages projects and volunteers for residential construction nonprofit lowernine.org. Her work experience has also included designing and installing commercial solar, shrimping, monitoring community water quality for a small nonprofit, serving coffee, and contributing to a multinational engineering company's water engineering department.

She is excited about using her evolving skills in STEM and understanding of social justice to build a more sustainable and equitable future for all. She also loves roller skating, hanging out with her dog, and kayaking in the swamp.
