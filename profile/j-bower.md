I'm an environmental geochemist interested in contaminant fate and transport, especially of the heavy metal variety. In the future, I'd like to tackle urban contamination problems from a historical and multidisciplinary context, while incorporating local place-based narratives, art and music connections, and open-source technologies. Areas of interest include the critical zone, science & technology studies (STS), critical physical geography, and urban biogeochemistry.
