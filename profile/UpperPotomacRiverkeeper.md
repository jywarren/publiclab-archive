Responsible for defending the public trust of the rivers and streams in the Upper Potomac by advocating for clean water and ensuring the the virtues of the Clean Water Act are enforced. I have been advocating for clean water for over 15 yrs and have a background in Environmental Science with an emphasis in fresh water ecology. I have experience in developing community water quality sampling programs, development of QAPPs, and project management focusing on building a legal or advocacy campaign on a pollution issue.  I have GIS experience and have used numerous technologies to gather environmental data, including data sensors, and drone photography.
