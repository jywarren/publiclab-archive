After a PhD in Environmental Engineering I started to work in R&D in the packaging field, first plastic containers and their interaction with food, then plastic bags for peritoneal dialysis and at the moment paperboard containers.
I am currently active in the environmental field trying to develop low cost sensors for home scale monitoring of the air quality (especially outside).
