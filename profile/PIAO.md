# PIAO

PIAO Atmospheric Observatory is an interdisciplinary collective of anthropologists, philosophers, architects, and friends drawn together by shared concern over air. Drawn together  in this medium with each other and many others, we develop experimental collaborations, concepts, and attunements for life in shared air.
