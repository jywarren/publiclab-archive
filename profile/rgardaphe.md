I work at qri (pronounced "query") a small startup in Brooklyn, NY. We're building an open-source dataset version control tool on the distributed web. Please reach out if your project might benefit from having a better solution to storing the data you generate and monitoring how that data changes over time.

I've got a background in politics / government (Obama campaign and White House), strategy consulting, and tech start-ups.
