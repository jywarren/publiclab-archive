I'm interested in PL because it facilitates development of low-cost alternatives for applied research. I am conducting agricultural research for assessing crop nutrient status and light-use efficiency.

I have experience using leaf biochemistry and canopy radiative transfer models (ProSAIL), radiometric field equipment (i.e. spectroradiometers, line and point quantum sensors, etc.), active multispectral sensors (i.e. CropCircle), passive multispectral sensors (i.e. TetraCam), and mapping/remote sensing software. A lot of the research I am doing involves the development of vegetation indices, crop area estimation, and aspects of how EMR can be used to study crop physiology.
