Megan J. Thompson, Legal Writer at Lawrina.com
As a graduate from the Washington College of Law, my emphasis was corporate law. I was able to enhance these skills while serving as the content writer and editor for my law school review journal. I also worked as a paralegal for private and public law firms, an opportunity that necessitated being a team player and required a deep level of professionalism. During that time it was the recipient of numerous service awards and scholastic awards based on my research papers and legal essays.
