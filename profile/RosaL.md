I am the Marine Biologist and Marine Program Manager for the Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation's Natural Resources Department.  I have been in this position for 8 1/2 years and have loved working for this Tribe.  The majority of my research and monitoring is done in the intertidal on a variety of species, such as, sea stars, surf smelt, seaweed, marine biotoxins, night fish, surf perch, chitons, and water quality.
