http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/User:2x2l . - Brief bio.

We can map the chronological evolution of my interests to form a rough correspondence to my values. Each discipline had ~5 years of study with a fair amount of rigor (unless indicated). Philosophy initially was a product of adolescent angst, the pursuit of which lead me to the standard absurdist/existentialist, then quickly to Bertrand Russell's seminal text. A sound philosophy requires a framework of consistency, which conveniently allowed me to explore both cutting edge mathematics, logic and computer science.[1]

Philosophy (analytical, a la Searle using post-Tractatus Wiggenstein as a vehicle. [Phenomenology, as well as the mind-body problem have both been resolved. Free will has been solved (Searle01). Truth can exist without a theory of truth (Roderick91)]) 
-> Frameworks of Logic (ZFC-independent constructs)/Pure Mathematics/Theoretical Computer Science (Homology + Type Theory, see Voevodsky's work at Princeton's IAS) 
-> Mechanical Engineering (hacked together an education on par with a semi-competent undergraduate, due in large part to my core competencies of mathematics/physics) 
-> Materials Science (even more recreationally) / Geotechnical engineering (focus on soil analysis w/r/t sound structural foundations as per ASME guidelines)
-> Horticulture and botany (if we feel generous, my scientific command of these disciplines is at an undergraduate 200 level) -- no formal training. "Learn as you go" via textbooks of repute. Objective of knowledge enrichment to contribute a foundation of knowledge in the field of sustainable ecology.

I've been an active open-source advocate (strictly GNU/AGPL) and active contributor since my mid-teens primarily within the Slackware Linux and Python communities. Profiteering off BSD/public domain code (a la the Silicon Valley) by selling a service based largely off free software, without releasing your code base into the public domain, is staunchly unethical(2).

[2] That's not to say that one cannot provide a value-add and profit from public domain software. This is a case study offering support-as-a-service by RedHat (i.e. for businesses that need service-level agreements and guaranteed top-tier support), while simultaneously releasing whatever additions they have made from community software, back into the community.
