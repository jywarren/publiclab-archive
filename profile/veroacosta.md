My name is Veronica Acosta. Iâ€™m interested in architecture as place-making and believe in the powerful relationship between place and behavior. My passion lies in people and the power that constructed environments have on our lifestyles; and the power that our lifestyles have on constructed environments. We are the place that surrounds us.
