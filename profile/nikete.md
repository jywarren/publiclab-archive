Interested in building appropriate sensors for the worlds major waterways. Experimenting around re-using truck tarp and plastic bottles to build hulls for water monitoring stations that can be inhabited and built upstream and navigated downstream while collecting measurements, with solar and small electric engines for navigation. The idea is to have this be a platform for both the use of water measurement as well as lab space for the development of new methods once the journey is over and the waterway reaches the sea/lake/bay.

My day job right now is  wrapping up a PhD in Machine Learning, currently I mostly work with applications around healthcare and community sovereignty. Academically I am: https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=_2Z3DcoAAAAJ&hl=en
