# Trillion_Trees

I’m artist, environmentalist, organiser, project developer and publisher from Leipzig in Germany.

I’m project founder of Greening Deserts and the Trillion Trees Initiative for biodiversity, climate protection, cleantech, ecological forestry, ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, greening, greentech, reforestation and species protection. he projects can reduce human-made climate change, deforestation, droughts, desertification, land degradation, global warming and pollution worldwide. We want to establish more climate camps, environmental and greening camps in regions who really need improvment of ecosystems and environments. Constructive feedback and real active support is always welcome.
