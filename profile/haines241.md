I'm Sarah Haines, a graduate student studying environmental science at The Ohio State University. My current research involves looking into microbial growth in carpet dust under varying relative humidity conditions but I am also involved on numeroud other projects. I received my undergraduate degree from OSU in environmental engineering in May of 2017 and have been working in Dr. Karen Dannemiller's lab since spring of 2016. I am also a member of the Ohio State University where you can find me rocking out the flute Tuesday and Thursday nights.
