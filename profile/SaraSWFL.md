Local community organizer active in Democratic politics in SWFL and Florida Wildflower Foundation Board member.

Currently working on an urban pollinator corridor project, “Butterflies to Billy Creek” to connect the Butterfly Estates, where the Florida Native Butterfly Society release captive-raised butterflies daily, to Billy Creek, which is an important local wildlife dispersal corridor. This involves creating high-quality pollinator habitat in private landscapes in three distinct neighborhoods, working with the City to change maintenance practices on public lands, and monitoring the effects of a highway removal project scheduled to begin later in the year on insect populations.
