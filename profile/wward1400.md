Balloon & kite mapping were my gateway interests.  I have worked with ArcGIS mostly and am working through open source tools.  
In the past, I've worked on restoring streams, monitoring sagebrush habitat, collecting data around Lake Pontchartrain forests with Tottori University, & georeferencing historical imagery for a US Fish & Wildlife Service Salt Marsh Integrity Index pilot project. <br>
I've lived around the Gulf Coast, West Coast, Williamette Valley, Southeast and New England feels like another home. However, Tennessee keeps pulling me.<br>I have lots of interests.
