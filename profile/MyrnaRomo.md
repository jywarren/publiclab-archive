# MyrnaRomo

Myrna Salgado-Romo is an activist and advocate for environmental justice in Chicago, IL.  Myrna has worked in charter school office administration for over 13 years and in 2018 helped form a union at her charter school.  In the same year she ,along with friends and neighbors, helped form and organize Neighbors for Environmental Justice to address the the inequities and negative impacts of environmental racism, racial justice, education justice, and climate justice in her McKinley Park community and surrounding Chicago neighborhoods.  Neighbors for Environmental Justice is currently fighting a public campaign against MAT Asphalt.  MAT Asphalt is a hot mix asphalt plant that emits carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic materials (VOMs) and particulate matter (PM).  McKinley Park, a community of primarily minority and low income residents, is now victim of yet another polluting industry.  McKinley park residents were not given notice and did not have any community input on the development of MAT Asphalt.
