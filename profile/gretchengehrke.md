I'm the Data and Advocacy Steward with Public Lab, and am an avid environmentalist living in Durham, North Carolina.  My background is in environmental geochemistry, and I am interested in the intersections and overlaps between environmental science and social justice.  Joining Public Lab, I am looking forward to getting involved in environmental protection in a more tangible way.
