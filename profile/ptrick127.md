I am an environmental scientist and recent graduate of CMU’s Public Policy and Management master’s program. While my early career was devoted to addressing water quality issues in my home state of Florida, I later relocated to the Peruvian Amazon, where for three years I managed the Amazon Conservation Association’s volunteer and biological monitoring programs. For the past five years, I have been using open source, peer-to-peer, and other collaborative tools and practices to make science and other forms of civic engagement more open and accessible to the public. As OSDC Project Coordinator, I leverage my multidisciplinary background and deep understanding of peer-to-peer culture and practices to provide technical and policy support to teams looking to harness the wisdom of the crowd, or simply to make science and STEM education opportunities more open and equitable.
