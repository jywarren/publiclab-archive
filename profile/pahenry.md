I am work with teachers and students in K-12 education. My background is in multimedia and GIS, and I have a strong interest in introducing GIS and remote sensing into classrooms. Currently, I am part of a team working on NASA funded project which employs kite-based remote sensing systems developed by NASA engineer Geoff Bland. These systems give students direct experience with RS technologies as they learn how remote sensing is used in the study of climate change.
