# sophied

Hello! I am a designer and researcher. I mostly work with NGOs on open source, data-driven projects. I am a member of the Feminist Open Source Investigations Group and, in collaboration with the geographer Sasha Engelmann aka @sashae, I am one half of #open-weather.

Over the radio waves, my callsign is M6NYX after the Greek goddess of the night.
