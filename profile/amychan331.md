Currently working to become a successful software engineer. I had a background in architecture with a particular interest in green build. Public Lab caught my attention as I was looking through Outreachy project listing because I have always wanted to use my skills to build something for the community, and I really like Public Lab's work to combine technology, open source, and environmental activism.
