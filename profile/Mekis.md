# Mekis

Biomedical laboratory scientist in Sweden, with a bachelorÂ´s degree in biomedical laboratory science. At home I have a light microscope with up to 100x magnification at the lenses. I also have a USB-camera. I have some other laboratory equipment as a micropipette, some histological materials and so on. I want to have my own lab at home, to analyze things from the human body and nature.
