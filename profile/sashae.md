# sashae

I am a London based geographer and creative practitioner exploring interdisciplinary, feminist and critical-creative approaches to environmental sensing. I collaborate with artists and activists to investigate different ways of tracing, monitoring and engaging with our environments that reach beyond models of capture and enumeration. I am an active member of the international Aerocene community, and a co-founder (with Sophie Dyer) of the feminist weather sensing project Open Weather.
