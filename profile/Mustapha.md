Hi, my name is Mustapha Dakhloul and I live in Bourj Al Shamali refugee camp in south Lebanon . I was part of the team who did the balloon mapping in the camp - and it was a lot of fun. With Claudia, I presented the work in Berlin, Germany, and it was lovely to see the positive feedback from people.

Very happy to join the Public Lab community. I am very interested in learning more civic science techniques, as I think many we can try and test in the camp.
