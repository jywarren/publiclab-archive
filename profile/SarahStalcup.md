# SarahStalcup

I am a recent graduate of Drexel University with an undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies and Sustainability and a minor in History as well as a Masterâ€™s degree in Environmental Policy. My primary interests are in environmental history, knowledge infrastructures, community engagement and how they pertain to how people perceive and live in our changing climate.
