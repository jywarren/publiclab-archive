I am Chemist and have worked with the "Water" in the last 10 years.

I use Linux and the programming language Tcl/Tk to automate experimental setups in lab and analysis of water, in studis about treatability of wastewater.

I believe it is very important to share knowledge about Water to collaborate in solving the challenges related with water.

I have organized information about water, water quality and automation in the laboratory (especially related with water) on www.c2o.pro.br

(I'm not fluent in English, so this site is only in Portuguese.)

I enjoyed to finding this project and hope to exchange information with participants.

Thanks,
Markos
