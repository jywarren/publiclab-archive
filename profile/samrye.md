# samrye

I have a background in environmental conservation, social enterprise, and strategic design.

My passion lies in supporting community-led environmental conservation & regeneration. I am exploring this through my Masters of Design which is focused on improving the social and environmental outcomes of conservation projects in Australia & New Zealand.

I also have a background in 'social labs' - a multi-stakeholder approach to tackling complex problems, which I aim to apply to environmental conservation challenges when I wrap up my Masters.
