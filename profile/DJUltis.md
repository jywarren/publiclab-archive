I am an open-hardware developer located in Boise, ID.  My day job is running the Reuseum,a local maker's mecca of cool industrial surplus, and facilitating our non-profit educational workshops and programming. I also develop my own projects as Citizen Scientific Workshop, LLC. 

Some of my earliest memories are of taking things apart, and thanks to the example of great heroes in my life, I learned to put things together too. Everyday, with whatever I can create and show, I hope to bring access to technology and science, and new capabilities to every individual in our world, so that we may all have ability to better empower and improve our own lives.
