I am a grassroots researcher with interest in learning more, educating and activating others regarding the pitfalls related to frac sand mining, processing, and trans-load of silica.The industry is tearing down hills, ridges, and bluffs and devastating clean air and water while leaving huge scars on the earth; other interests include building a cleaner and safer world by networking, creating coalitions and working groups, and creating awareness of the impacts of the fossil fuel addiction on our daily lives to make the transition.
