I had started my artistic work in 2002, and in 2012 I created Experimentações EletrOrgânicas [0], a nomad lab focused in the relation between people and the environment. Since 2004 I'm part of MetaReciclagem [1], a network focused in appropriation of technology. I'm one of the founders of Garoa Hacker Clube [1], the first hackerspace in Brazil, worked as tech manager at ecoLab, where InfoAmazonia [1] and Mapas Coletivos[2] projects where created, and now I'm coordinating Rede InfoAmazonia [3], a project that will use sensors to measure water quality in some places in Amazonia.
