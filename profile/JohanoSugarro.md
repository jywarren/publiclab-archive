Hey there. I'm John, 25 yers old, livin' in New York. I'm interested in music, painting and sport. Used to play volleyball a lot, but now my left arm is broken :( I'm looking for some new community which develops and applies open-source tools. I've heard Public Lab could be good place for me. Friend of mine told me that ;)
