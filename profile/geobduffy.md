I'm a Geographer by education and training. I have 12+ years experience in applied GIS and spatial analysis. I recently created a website called flightriot.com as a forum to learn and share with others experiences related to aerial mapping with small UAV. 

Of particular interest to me is generating VIs such as NDVI using a single camera. I'd like to create (or participate in creating) an affordable solution for small or large scale farmers to assess crop health and better manage there resources.
