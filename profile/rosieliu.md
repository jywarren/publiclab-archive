# rosieliu

This is Rosie from Cusabio, a biotech company. I'm working as an editor there right now. My major was not related to biology when I was in college. But Iâ€™m interested in biology very much. It is the reason I choose to work for a biotech company. I would like to share some biotechnology related content with you here.
