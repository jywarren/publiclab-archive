I like helping kids trace out in chalk the old streams that used to run through their playgrounds. Public Lab provides fun tools for making the historic invisibles come to the surface again, where a pattern of puddles on the basket ball court hints at where the fish once were, the tarmac sinking on the softer riverbed soils.

I can help out with historical analysis of sites. Working to take balloon and kite pictures around an urban waterfront Superfund site in Brooklyn, I can help out with questions about mapping water pollution issues and urban ecology analysis.
