We are a group of teen scientist searching for similarities between the effects of sunscreen on coral/ freshwater hydra. We are working to grow our own Hydra and test different sunscreens based on SPF/brand/and oxybenzone levels. We're excited to get to learn from the different scientist on this sight and hope our findings peak y'all's interest.
