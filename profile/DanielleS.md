I'm so excited to be the Community Science Soil Testing Fellow this winter! I'm currently in my first year of a PhD program in Environmental Toxicology at University of California, Riverside. I also run D.I.Y. Fungi, to share skills about growing mushrooms for food, medicine and earth renewal, and do applied research about bioremediation. I am passionate about community organizing, education and action around food systems, pollution, and waste issues; and am part of several groups working on these: CoRenewal, Mycoremediation Division (of Mushroom Mountain) and Healing City Soils.
