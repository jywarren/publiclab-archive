# PlaceMatters

PlaceMatters believes in informed, effective, and equitable citizen engagement.  We work to ensure that communities and organizations design and implement processes that garner broad public involvement and support, educate participants, and lead to sustainable, livable communities.  PlaceMattersâ€™ Decision Lab works with tinkerers, hackers, designers, coders, and practitioners in building the next generation of tools and techniques for better decision making around planning and sustainability.  As such, our interests with PLOT are closely aligned.
