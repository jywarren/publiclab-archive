I am an artist, producer, manager, and photographer living in Guelph, Canada. I am particularly interested in lens-based and social practice art, and open culture. I'm also really fascinated by anything related to transmission and/or reception of radio waves! I'm a radio amateur and a transmission art dabbler. Most recently, I coordinated the Creative Commons 2018 Global Summit in Toronto. I spent most of my career working with performers, and over the last ten years have focused increasingly on my own creative practice. Most recently I have had the good fortune to worth with social practice artists Gregory Sale and Matthew Moore, supporting projects for them in California, Arizona, and Ontario.
