I am a young artist working on developing concepts and pieces which base is to compare relations between human and nature. I am interested to develop works where biology and technology of DIY techincs meets art and vice versa.
In this frames I have explored soil and water, living plants in the paper and fabric and I am looking forward to explore more!
