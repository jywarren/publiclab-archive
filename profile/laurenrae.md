# laurenrae

 I'm a Public Lab organizer in New Orleans and  a recent graduate of the Louisiana State University School of Renewable Natural Resources.  My major is watershed science with a minor in wetland ecology and restoration.
 
I'm passionate about wetland wildlife, especially birds. Since the winter of 2013, I've been studying the avian response to restoration projects in the Mississippi River Delta.

I'm also very passionate about citizen science and community engagement.  I used to work as an urban planner and headed a community mapping project in New Orleans called NolaCycle.  I'm involved in Public Lab because I want to help people understand their environment by giving them the tools to monitor changes in the water, air, and soil in their community.
