I am the Program Director for a small nonprofit,  Val Verde Air Monitoring Program. I am currently working as a Public Lab Fellow. I live in the small, semi-rural town of Val Verde, California, in LA County. I got started with environmental justice advocacy and waste issues after a nearby landfill began the scoping process for an expansion, rather than close the facility as promised. 

Public Lab's right-to-know ethos is a fundamental, shared value of mine. I am also an Organizer in the Los Angeles area. I can be reached at sage.vvamp@gmail.com

My github username is sarasage. 

I am a graduate of California Institute of the Arts and am an artist.
