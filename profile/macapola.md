 Industrial designer. Ive dedicated my professional life to consultancy in technological product development and design of collaborative and creative working spaces.
Since 2004 i have participated in various collectives, projects and companies dedicated to design, art and creation, such as Santiago Maker space (the first makerspace in Chile)
I dedicate most of my time to play (through art and design) and investigate about the influence of creative abilities in life, human interaction and learning.
