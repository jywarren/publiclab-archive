I am a British producer and designer with an interdisciplinary approach. Currently managing the development of an open conservation tech product called FieldKit, due to launch in 2020.

FieldKit lets everyone everywhere monitor the world around them with low-cost, reliable sensors, and easy-to-use tools for storing, sharing and telling stories with data.
