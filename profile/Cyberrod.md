My day job is a environmental geologist.  I work for a company that investigates and remediates environmental releases.  I also teach geology at Washtenaw Community College in Ann Arbor Michigan.  

I'm also a member of the Michigan Robotics Club and a technology enthusiast. This community seems like a perfect match for my interests.
