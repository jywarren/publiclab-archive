I believe that learning to make information makes us better consumers of information. I believe that when we make stuff together we build a stronger community. I believe open data is not just access to government records, it is the ability to make our own information. 

I have made maps and analyzed data for  for nonprofits and foundations for over 15 years. I arm the good guys with strong quantitative arguments.

I am interested in how people use public space. I am interested in monitoring the water quality in the waterways  in my community. I want to build cool stuff with curious people. I want to keep learning. 

I live in Philadelphia.
