Hi, I am Sanchit. I am a student, a researcher in robotics, a web developer, a drone specialist and a hardcore tech enthusiast.

I love to tinker around with prototyping platforms and research on new technologies. As a child i wanted to be a pilot but later I found out my interest in robotics, research and development (R&D). I always like to help people as much as possible.
