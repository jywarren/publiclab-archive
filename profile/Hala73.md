I am an agricultural engineer and I've created hardware and simple apps to streamline the process of biodegradable waste into fertilizer (namely an electric earthworm separator). I also created the Suspended Garden and a modular system for processing waste through earthworms indoors, without odours. I now work as a product developer for a company that devices vertical indoor farms. I am creating feedback loops and hardware that allows growing plants vertically, in organic media. I have implemented prevision Ag and NDVI tools in my past academic research, and I am now figuring out how to incorporate NDVI and infrared sensing into sensors for intense indoor farming. I'm happy to learn from others and share what I know as well.
