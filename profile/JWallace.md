I am an ex-viticulturalist amongst other random things. I'm learning to code with a view to make a business out of agricultural software and maybe a little hardware. My interests are mainly around drones, cameras, AI and NDVI software. I believe in the idea of high performance but very low cost solutions that are accessible to individual small businesses.
