I am an electronic engineer, currently  I am working with an agricultural engineer team, and we are getting together different kind of things as the use of drones, or NDVI cameras to get as much advantages as possible in our favor in the agricultural matter. I do not have a lot of experience with agriculturar stuff, but I like to mix my electgronic with this.
