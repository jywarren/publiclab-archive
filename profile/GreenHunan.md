# GreenHunan

This is Green Hunan, a not-for-profit conservation organisation based in Hunan, China. We were founded in 2007 in the rapidly developing capital of Hunan Province, which is located on the banks of the Xiang River, a major tributary to the Yangtze. Green Hunan focuses on protecting the Xiang and other major water systems through a widespread citizen monitoring network called the “The River Watchers.” Volunteers in the network conduct regular testing of water quality at designated monitoring stations, track pollutants, and record any environmental changes in the watershed. These efforts have led local environmental officials to pay greater attention to pollution discharges in the Xiang River and its tributaries.
