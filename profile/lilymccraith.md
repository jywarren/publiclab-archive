I am a designer, researcher and creative technologist working across technologies and disciplines. My work investigates systems, infrastructures and ecologies via active methods of research, enquiry and collaboration. 

I am currently exploring what's under the ground as well as creating DIY mapping and visualising tools such as kite photogrammetry and DIY LiDAR
