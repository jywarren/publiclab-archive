I am from Lee NH, a farmer, PhD student in natural resources and earth systems science and the director of a NH based non-profit called GreenStart which was created to share technology for healthy soil, food and energy. (www.greenstartnh.org)

My research, farming and passion is focused around regenerative systems and building networks that facilitate opensource exchange of knowledge. (eg.  public labs and farmhack.net)
