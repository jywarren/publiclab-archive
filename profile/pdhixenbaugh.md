# pdhixenbaugh

I work in environmental education and watershed protection, with a background in chemistry (and to a lesser extent, physics/electronics). I believe in connecting people with ideas, clarifying concepts, and staying true to the purpose of science - to discover, to understand, and to inform public policy. My public involvement in investigating and protecting the environment starts with a community that shares these beliefs, and depends on open access to scientific methods and tools to do the work, and share the results.
