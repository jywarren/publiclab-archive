# englishkillsproject

In 2012 I founded the ENGLISH KILLS PROJECT, a socially engaged, bio-art project that seeks an ecological transformation of English Kills, a tributary of Newtown Creek in Brooklyn. This entire waterway was declared a Superfund site in 2009 and I currently reside 4 blocks from the creek in Bushwick. I collaborate with the biologist Dr. Sarah Durand, the Newtown Creek Alliance and engage with neighborhood residents to bring greater awareness about nature in an urban environment and its Superfund status. The ENGLISH KILLS PROJECT is about re-imagining a public commons, alternative bio-remediation processes to clean the water of the creek, creating a new consciousness about our inter-relationship with this nature and environmental justice in a poor neighborhood of color. It is a project whose re-imaginations migrate between the science lab, the artist studio, nature and the public commons. The ENGLISH KILLS PROJECT creates an art practice framework where biology, science and public planning can intersect with art making, performance, lectures, creative speculation and social engagement with a sense of mission that art can have impact on society.
