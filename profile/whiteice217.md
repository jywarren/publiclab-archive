I'm 29 years old. I have a degree in network administration and made it part way through nursing school. I dropped out when my daughter was born. Since then I have focused on becoming a father and a better husband. After the birth of my daughter I realized that the choices I make today affect the life of my little. It was that thought that started a fire in me. I believe we all have purpose and right now I do not feel as though I have found mine. I know big things are coming my way and I want to be ready for them. I want to make sure that my daughter and her children can see and love the world around them as I can today.
