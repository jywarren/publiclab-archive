Semi-retired tech serial entrepreneur now doing olive oil.  I'd like to see PLOTS get the ability to analyze olive oil - to measure polyphenol levels and to detect adulterated oil - either from blending with other oils or with solvent extracted oils.

Caltech grad in EE/CS/Optics in 1978, started or helped start 17 companies in my life.
