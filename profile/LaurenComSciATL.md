I'm an aspiring sustainability guru and enthusiastic community lover who uses curiosity, wisdom and a smile to build trust, change minds and create lasting connections. From internships with the Center for Disease Control, Greenpeace USA and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, I've built a strong base in public service and activism. And with trips to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in both Paris, France and Bonn, Germany I've gotten my feel for international environmentalism both in theory and practice. Right now, I live my days as a "classic millennial" at home with my parents as I apply to grad school and build my career as a Community Science Coordinator and Outreach Specialist with the city of Atlanta's ONLY urban nature center: West Atlanta Watershed Alliance. We inspire folks from "K-Grey" in the historic West Atlanta area (noted as MLK's old stomping grounds) to protect, preserve and restore our community's natural resources.
