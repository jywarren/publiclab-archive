# kanarinka

My background is in the arts, software development and civic media. I'm interested in ways to engage the public in collecting, analyzing and taking action on environmental data. 

At Public Lab I was previously helping to organize the Open Water/Riffle project with Don Blair. I'm deeply interested in how we get broader audiences engaged with environmental data that matters for their everyday lives. 

I'm also interested in data visualization and data storytelling in a journalism context and I'd like to help build Public Lab connections in those areas.

You can find me at www.kanarinka.com.
