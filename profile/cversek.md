I am a graduate student in experimental physics at UMass Amherst.  Having benefited from the use open source tools in my research to automate data acquisition and analysis, I've become interested to partcipate more in online development communities.  As members of the Pioneer Valley Open Science (PVOS) group, we are engaged in developing open and affordable techniques for simple experiment automation and monitoring of laboratory conditions.
