# What tests are recommended to check for toxicity levels in the home?

I purchased an older home (built in 1976) in 2013\.  I was so impressed with the solid structure of the entire home.  The original solid wood panels and beams.  However, after a short while, i noticed an unusual amount of dust on every surface.  It was unrelenting.  The air filters had to be changed before their due date.  We had the carpet ripped out as well as the drapes.  We replaced all the old windows.  Still, the dust was everywhere.  Around this time, I started to notice changes in my health.  I have developed debilitating inflammation in my joints to the point of not being able to get out of bed.  I have no idea if these two are connected but I would definitely like to check my home for any levels of toxicity.  What would you recommend that I start with?
