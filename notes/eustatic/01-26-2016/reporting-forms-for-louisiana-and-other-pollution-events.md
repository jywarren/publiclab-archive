# Reporting Forms for Louisiana (and other) pollution events

###What I want to do

Link a clip from LEAN's [recent guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9TzfQJ7Qw4GcU1IVkFaVkNqcTg/view?usp=sharing) to environmental action.

LEAN and Tulane Environmental Law Clinic have both recently published Citizen's Guides to Environmental Protection that are worth elevating. 

This portion of this Guide can be distributed alongside the OTK to communities concerned about reporting oil pollution in Louisiana. 

I have added the National Response Center's number as a contact, so that Citizens and Environmental Organizations can monitor reports with [Skytruth Alerts.](alerts.skytruth.org) 

The Louisiana Bucket Brigade also has a [iWitness reporting map](http://map.labucketbrigade.org/).
