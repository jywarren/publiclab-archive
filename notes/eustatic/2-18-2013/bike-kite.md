how to bike your kite.  

(reel mounted on handlebars not shown)

mounting options for the rolled kite

1) shoestring  (bowline, lace through to tighten, half hitch to tie off

2) the bend of your cable lock looped around the seat post

if you have dropped handlebars, be careful not to extend the kite forward of the top bar.
