# the Hills have Acne: passenger pigeon photos of drill sites out West

my phone GPS was not working at 20k feet, so i don't know where these photos were taken--somewhere between PDX to Houston, closer to PDX. but these are drill pads.  Just like in Louisiana. 

There's photos of Salt Lake(?) taken just before these. 

Wyoming?
41.427283,-110.842438

Was there ever a One-Pager written?

Could the Passenger Pigeon Site include Baton Rouge (nee Exxon) and Norco (nee Shell Motiva) as potential sites to photograph from starboard-side windows approaching BTR and MSY, respectively?
