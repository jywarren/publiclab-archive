# [organizing] Mapknitters Gulf Coast --first meeting

###what's up

Some of us on the Gulf Coast got together to hang out on mapknitter and make maps from existing photography.  a Nascent Public Lab Cartography Collective. 

###My attempt and results

We started a process document [here](http://goo.gl/19lOQS).  We have a number of New Orleans Locations where we can meet over computers.

We are meeting and communicating over the Gulf Coast and Public Lab and Grassroots mappers lists, so sign up!

The first two sets of photos we have to work with are for Bayou St John, and [Bayou Bienvenue Shoreline](http://publiclab.org/blog).  
[Download them from google drive here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7MlfaDJlEh9N0ZIcE50UWh3bEU&usp=sharing&invite=CKrNqYkE)

Soon, we will discuss GroundworkNOLA's photos of MacMain's schoolyard. 

Scott will make a wiki page for all of the photography that is unmapped for the [Gulf Coast here:](http://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/10-27-2013/balloon-mapping-of-bienvenue-wetland-triangle-bulrush-planting)
