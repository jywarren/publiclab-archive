Dr. Brian Gullett is a scientific and technical professional, senior research engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development. Dr. Gullett's presentation focused on the use of a blimp, also known as and aerostat, to study the toxicity of emissions from in situ burning that occurred during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.. This presentation was given as part of the "Technology used to study oil spills Part 2" seminar held on August 29, 2018 in Ocean Springs, MS.
