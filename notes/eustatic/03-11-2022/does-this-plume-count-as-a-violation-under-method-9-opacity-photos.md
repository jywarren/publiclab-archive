# Does this plume count as a violation under Method 9 Opacity? (photos)

Does this count? It is an operations fugitive emissions point source for Rain CII Carbon in St John Parish, Louisiana.

I can't get within a quarter mile, this photo is from half a mile away, across the river.

The operations happen mostly in the afternoon until early morning.

Louisiana DEQ has a Method 9 certified staff member, but i've only ever seen them dismiss complaints--LDEQ usually comes to inspect two weeks after the incident, and ~75% of the time, the facility isn't conducting the same operations two weeks later.

My thinking is that this is enough to request that the LDEQ staff trained on Method 9 appear at this site when operations are happening.
