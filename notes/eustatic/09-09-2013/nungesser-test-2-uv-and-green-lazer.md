# Nungesser test #2, UV and green lazer 

##What I want to do

From the previous note, test the coal or petroleum coke sample for contaminants.<br> 

In addition to this testing, the Clean Gulf Commerce Coalition is working with Global Community Monitor to analyse drum samples of particles of coal that Plaquemines residents are breathing. <br>

Here's the sample from last time. I left the drippings from the fork on top of the jar to show the results of what the mixture of coal chunk in mineral oil looks like.<br>

Overnight, the sediment in the jar had settled.  So the jar was briefly shaken to get the black liquid into suspension, then poured into the sampling vial. 

##My attempt and results

The green lazer test showed no [discoloration](http://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/08-01-2013/zapping-grand-isle-coffee-team-orca-and-the-green-laser), only green color before being dissipated into the mix<br>

The UV test also showed no fluoresence of the blackened solution, only a limited penetration<br>

##Questions and next steps

I would like to confirm my visuals with the spectrometer. 

I might wait for the sediments to settle and try again, this time with the spectrometer. 

I should break out my mineral oil control, and  compare the spectra.
