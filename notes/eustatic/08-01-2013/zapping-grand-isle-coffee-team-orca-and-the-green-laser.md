# Zapping Grand Isle Coffee: Team Orca and the green laser

##What I want to do

Per Jeff's repeated suggestion, I zapped the [two dilutions of Grand Isle Tar Balls](http://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/08-01-2013/making-grand-isle-coffee) in mineral oil with a green lazer.

These samples were prepared with the help of Courtney Kearney.

##My attempt and results

real quick, here are pictures.  the x100 dilution still looks green.

x10 dilution looks a different color, though.

##Questions and next steps

It attenuates the laser, yes?
