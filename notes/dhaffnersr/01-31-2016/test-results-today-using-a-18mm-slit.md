# Test results today using a .18mm slit

Below are some of my test results for today, I replaced the slit that comes with the spectrometer kit and replaced it with an .18mm slit (I bought a set of different sizes at the publiclab store) I am very happy with results so far, I am getting a lot cleaner image and data from the re-sizing.
