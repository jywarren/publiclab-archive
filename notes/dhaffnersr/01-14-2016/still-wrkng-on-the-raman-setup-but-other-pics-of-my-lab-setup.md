# STILL WRKNG ON THE RAMAN SETUP, BUT OTHER PICS OF MY LAB SETUP

This is related to my previous post. 

I am trying out a new Halogen lamp I bought, I don't know I'm not too happy with the results, it may be the detector's limitations, I am going to replace the DVD piece on the HD camera and replace it with a higher quality diffraction grate.

Also, I did find when using the halogen lamp I needed to measure some distances from light source to sample and detector from sample, mostly for focus and frequency attenuation. I wrote down the measurements in my notes. 

I am working on an easier raman setup for myself, the picture I have up of my raman setup is not finished, but the basics are are still the same...laser light to excite the sample, liberate electrons and focus the sample correctly to the detector's slit.
