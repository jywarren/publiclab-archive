# Using Precision Measurements for Qualitative Analysis-Eosin Y in NaOH3

**Abstract**
This is a continuation on my series of using precision measurements for qualitative analysis from my previous research note. The picture was representative of Eosin Y at 5 different concentration levels ranging from 0.1 ml to 0.5 ml, using a Serological pipette pump and 1ml Serological pipette to dispense the precise amount of dilute concentration level.

The results from this type of accuracy is demonstrated in my second research note in this series in figure 1, the plot shows the similarities in wave forms between the data plot from the Oregon Medical Laser Center and that of my plot, further demonstrated is, that the quantum yield of my scan of Eosin Y was very close to that of the OMLCâ€™s data.

This is significant in part because it demonstrates even further, that it is possible to achieve reliable and accurate results from a homemade spectrometer as long as certain criteria are met.
