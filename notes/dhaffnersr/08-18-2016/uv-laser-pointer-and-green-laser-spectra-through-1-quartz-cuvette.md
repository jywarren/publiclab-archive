# UV Laser Pointer and Green Laser Spectra Through 1 Quartz Cuvette

##**2 Different Laser Wavelength's through 6 Different Solvents**




I wanted to test the resolution of my 0.09mm slit width, so what better way to do that then, aiming a laser through a quartz cuvette filled with 6 different solvents, and here are my results:

1 quartz cuvette was used for all spectral scans.
Instrumentation: DH 4.0 v4 Spectrometer

Solvents used were:

1) Isopropyl alcohol [99.99% purity-certified by Duda Energy LLc]
2) Ethanol [95% purity-200proof] Consolidated Chemical Corp.
3) Acetone [99.5 + -%] lab quality- Consolidated Chemical Corp.
4)Ethyl Acetate - lab grade Consolidated Chemical Corp.
5) Methanol [99.65+%] Lab grade Consolidaed Chemical Corp.
6) Distilled Water - Store bought [TDS meter used {total dissolved solids = 0}
