# This CFL works the best

After a thousand spectral tests, I have found one CFL that I have gotten a quality calibration fit of 4 with, below is a picture of two I have tested and the one that lost an the winner!

Also I just want to point out that you will notice I have my CFL pointed at about a 45 degree angle this is the perfect angle for this type of CFL that I have found.
