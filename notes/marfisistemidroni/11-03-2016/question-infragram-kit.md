# Question infragram kit


Hi! I bought the kit infragram I wanted to mount on the camera of a drone DJI Phantom 3 (it's practically a gopro HERO3), I wanted to know if I can remove the IR filter in front of CCD and insert the infragram filter in front of the optics, as a classic ND1 filter. So you can switch between red lens and blue lens. Or they are forced to add in front of the CCD. Also, if you could, that formula can be used for processing with the NDVI Agisoft PhotoScan. Thank you
