# Communities Restoring Urban Swamp Habitat Project

Charlotte and Rollin, 2/3 of the Oil & Gas Water Fellowship Trio, tabled an event with some water samples and sensors to whet your appetite for learning about water quality. We compared the water quality of a number of samples from in and around the Lower Ninth Ward, and showed how readings from a few different sensors compared to each other. Community members were able to ask questions and learned how to accurately test household drinking water.
