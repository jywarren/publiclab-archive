# Question: Do you guys retract the kite / balloon line manually?

###What I want to do or know
I was wondering if the line of the mapping balloons / kites is operated manually (hand spooling) most of the time. Using a special spool with a cordless drill / driver with a direction toggle could make the process much less tiring and faster while avoiding rope burns. 

Designing such a spool, with an attached rod that can be mounted in the drill should not be very difficult, and could be valuable for the community due to the easy access to cordless drills.

You can find some similar designs on google image search by querying "drill line spooler".
