# GLAM Event 9/27/14

Thank you to everyone who participated in Saturday's GLAM Event, it was a great success!

It was a beautiful day for balloon mapping with now hiccups or mishaps and we got some great pictures we can't wait for you to see.

I'm attaching the Field Notes from Saturday and I look to write more about the event soon and stitching the photos together, stay tuned!
