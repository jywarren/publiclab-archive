# How to process images using a mobius with an IR lens?

###What I want to do or know
 Using a mobius camera with the IR Lens form public lab can I calculate NDVI operating the red and near infrared band as its formula suggests (since the modified lend substitutes blue with near infrared) ?? do I still need the white balance???

###Background story
Hello! hey I'm planning on doing some NDVI for a school project and I happen to have the code in Matlab to calculate NDVI having the value of each band in a picture. Im really interested in your Infragram Plant Cam and IR Lens but I don't understand just yet how this white balancing works.
