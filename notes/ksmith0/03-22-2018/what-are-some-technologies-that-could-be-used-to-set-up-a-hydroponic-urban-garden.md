# What are some technologies that could be used to set up a hydroponic urban garden?

I've been looking into an urban garden project for Birmingham, AL. I have been trying to do some research on hydroponics and vertical farming, but am curious if there are any better methods out there currently or easier ways to accomplish the project given the environment and space in the area.
