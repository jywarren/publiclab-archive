# Pendulum or Picavet for Kites. Why?

Hi [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)! Apologies if this has been answered elsewhere, but as I've been searching I haven't found an explicit answer.

What about the pendulum and the picavet makes the picavet better for Kite photography? According to what I can find, the pendulum works better for vertical lines, like with a balloon on a calm day. Does the picavet handle the erratic motion of the kite line better, and provide better stability than a pendulum would?

I would like to try the jerkpan on the aerobee with a kite, and it looks like if I could only buy one, I would get the pendulum. What do you think?
