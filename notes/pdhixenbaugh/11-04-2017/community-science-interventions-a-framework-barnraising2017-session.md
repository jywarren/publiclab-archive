# Community Science Interventions: A Framework (Barnraising2017 Session)

(Draft) These were our take-aways we wanted to share from the session:
(Photo of whiteboard upcoming)

     * Framework:
            * What (is the issue?)
            * Where is it? (Sources, Exposures)
            * Who (has leverage, is affected)
            * How (can the who intervene, can it be done, and what resources are necessary?)
    * Framework & scope are useful for discussion purposes. General scope leads to less useful, general notions, specific scope leads to specific, perscriptive notions. (Prioritizing  sources, etc.)

    * Information appropriate for the desired use: Gardeners don't want theoretical things, they want something prescriptive. (Not "Well you can do this, or you could do that, or maybe this is possible...")
    * Gathering information: breaking out of Silos
