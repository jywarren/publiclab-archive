# Activity Grids formatting - what will be their final form? 

Hi all,

I've got a few open questions about the new activity grid system.

First, is the layout still in development? Could there be more obvious space between essential activities, and specialized activities? 

Taking a look at the activity grid over at https://publiclab.org/wiki/coqui, I see 10 activities listed together, with different statuses, categories, and so on. I discovered you can sort by category as well. But my overall impression is that there are an awful lot of things there to try, and to me it's overwhelming to see them all at once.

Has there been thought on visibly separating activities by something like

"Category 1: Basics"
"Category 2: Essential next steps"
"Category 3: Optional addons"

and maybe making the list of activities more approachable by only having 2 or 3 in "basics" and so on?

Thanks, and I hope this is the right spot for this!
