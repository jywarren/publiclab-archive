# How do you change a research note into a question?

###What I want to do or know
* General: Can published research notes be converted to questions?
* If so, how?

###Background story

I accidentally created a [research note](https://publiclab.org/notes/pdhixenbaugh/10-04-2016/activity-grids-formatting-what-will-be-their-final-form) when I meant to create a question. It has some nice comments -- so is there a way to change it to the "question" post type?
