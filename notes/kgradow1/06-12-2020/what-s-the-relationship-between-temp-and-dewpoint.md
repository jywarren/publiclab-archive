# What's the relationship between temp and dewpoint?

Inspired by @eustatic [Timeline for June 10 Climate Rain][1] I looked up my nearest weather station in Centerdale RI and found this graph.

I can't tell what I'm looking at here.  Are they mapped closely with each other because it's night?  Or am I looking at rain?   Why is there a split between temp and dewpoint during the daytime hours?
