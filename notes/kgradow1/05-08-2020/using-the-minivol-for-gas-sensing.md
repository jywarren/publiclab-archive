# MiniVol for gas sensing?

I'm mostly asking out of curiosity. [Public Lab's MiniVol documentation](https://publiclab.org/search?q=minivol "https://publiclab.org/search?q=minivol") focuses on particulate monitoring but does note that it can be used with Tedlar bags. Has anyone used it in this way?  @mathew
