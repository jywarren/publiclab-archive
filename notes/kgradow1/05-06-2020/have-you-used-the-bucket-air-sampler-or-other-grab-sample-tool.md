# Have you used the bucket air sampler or other grab sample tool?  

Public Lab is looking for individuals or organizations who have experience with the bucket sampler to better understand ongoing needs and considerations around use of this tool. If you've used buckets - or Summa canisters, or any method for measuring gases in air samples - I would love to talk to you about your experience!

From PL's [Air Sampling](https://publiclab.org/wiki/air-sampling) page: Air grab sampling is a way to capture air samples for laboratory testing. Most air grab sampling methods involve capturing air pulled into a bag through a vacuum system. The bag can then be sealed and shipped to a lab for testing. Air grab samples can be tested for over 100 different chemicals ([Louisiana Bucket Brigade](http://www.labucketbrigade.org/content/bucket)).
