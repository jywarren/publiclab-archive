# Risks of PAH exposure from contaminated dust?

I live in Providence where there was recently a large exposed pile of contaminated fill related to a highway project that was left uncovered form 3 months (potentially much longer). It was subsequently covered and then removed, but there are significant concerns about community exposure from dust blowing off the site. Here is one of the early articles covering the issue: [https://www.golocalprov.com/news/EXCLUSIVE-Union-Official-Says-RIDOT-Allows-Contractor-to-Illegally-Dump-Co](https://www.golocalprov.com/news/EXCLUSIVE-Union-Official-Says-RIDOT-Allows-Contractor-to-Illegally-Dump-Co)

**RIDOH (Health Department) has stated that they found PAH concentrations (including benzypyrene) ranging from non-detect to 3 mg/kg**. Residential standard (lifetime exposure) - .4 mg/kg. Industrial commercial standard (exposure from working - long-term exposure - .8 mg/kg, but those are both long-term exposure standards. Apparently soil samples on the site also tested positive for low levels of lead.

I am going to cross-reference this with some of the air quality resources on PL, but does anyone have experience with PAH testing to help put these numbers in context? We are expecting to get more information in the coming days on the testing plan, how samples were taken, and what the specific levels are, and it would be great to get some community perspectives on how to put this information in context.
