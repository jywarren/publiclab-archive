# What diagnostic tools do you use when air sampling? 

When you are planning an air study, what are the first-pass tools you use to diagnose problems?  This is related to the bucket monitor project.   I'm interested in how buckets have been used in combination with formaldehyde badges, summa canisters, and other tools.
