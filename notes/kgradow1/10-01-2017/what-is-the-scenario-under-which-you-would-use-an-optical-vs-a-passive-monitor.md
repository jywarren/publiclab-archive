# What is the scenario under which you would use an optical vs. a passive monitor to measure dust? 

Assuming that all conditions are perfect and you can get high-quality data from either one.

Which one would I use...

- If I live alongside a highway and want to know - generally - what's in the air?
- If I live alongside the highway and want to know - specifically - when it's safe to go outside?
- If I live near an industrial facility and want to record combustion particles at a particular time?
- If I don't care about time and want to measure particle size and shape?
