# Can we add a 2um filter to the bucket monitor to capture particulates?

This question was asked by @mimiss during this week's Open Hour.

The [bucket monitor](https://publiclab.org/wiki/bucket-2020-relaunch-and-update) is used to sample chemicals in the air including VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and sulfur compounds. Buckets are similar to Summa canisters, which capture 30-hour samples in a polished container. Summa canisters come with a 2um filter that is built into the flow controller to prevent contamination of the intake valve. This is a two-part question:

- Can this be added to the bucket valve?
- Can the filter be analyzed independently to get a snapshot of particulate matter?
