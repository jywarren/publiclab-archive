# World's fastest and super cheap automated cell counter!

[https://academist-cf.com/projects/?id=39](https://academist-cf.com/projects/?id=39) ←Cloud funding now.

Need a feed back from scientist for improvement and funds.

Processing speed: 0.3 sec/sample ( existing cell counter needs almost 10seconds)

cost: lower than 700＄（exsisting cellcounter 4000＄）

Demonstration movie.

Build a cell counting program with OpenCV(C++)

I used a cheap USB camera.

The attachment built by 3D printer and installed some parts by hand.
