# How can I start a project on environmental air quality around crop dusting areas

I live in a city with crops around and when they are doing crop dusting it smells really strong and I am concerned of the health effects it can have on kids and people in general. 

  
Please help so we can see if they are applying pesticides that have harmful effects on human health
