# Calibration Issues with larger images 

Is anyone else having troubles with the calibration functions on the site?
When attempting to calibrate a spectrum using copy calibration the graph remains greyed out and nothing happens.
when trying to manually calibrate the spectrum I get the error "The tag you've applied couldn't be saved, but it's been run locally. Clear it now."
