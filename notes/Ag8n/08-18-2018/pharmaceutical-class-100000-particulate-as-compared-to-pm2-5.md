# Pharmaceutical class 100000 particulate as compared to pm2.5

In the pharmaceutical industry, we frequently had to certify clean rooms as class 100,000 (or better).  This took laser particle counters that counted and sized each individual particle.  We had them both for air and liquids.  So the question is- how do you convert class 100,000 to pm2.5 or pm10?
