# Possible sources of more spectrometer information

Not a question.  Ran across the national science digital library NSDL, the other day.  It's a good source of some tutorials.  Google it, if interested.

  
The one most applicable is a spin off of the NSDL, the Analytical Science Digital Library (ASDL).  It lists many papers using different techniques.  For anyone who is interested. Google for more info.
