# Sanity check for air sensors

One sanity check often used for particle sensors was to block the input with a good quality air filter and make sure the number of particles dropped to zero.  If it didn't drop to zero, probably the particle counter was messed up.

Is this approach viable for pm2.5 and pm10 sensors?  What kind of filter would you use?

Thank you!
