# Can the spectrometer or turbocharger be used for lal testing?

I need the help of a microbiologist.  L.a.l. or lysate testing is often used to test for pyrogens.  That is microbes that can produce a reference if dead.  It often used an extract of horseshoe crab blood to do this.  

  
The test can be done visually, via turbidity, or with a spectrometer.  The spectrometer used 405 nm, which is pushing it for the public labs spectrometer.  

  
What special equipment, testing, etc.,is needed for the microbiological end of the test?

  
Thank you.
