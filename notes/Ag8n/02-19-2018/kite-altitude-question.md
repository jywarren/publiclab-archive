# Kite altitude question

An ancient question.  How do you calculate the kite altitude knowing only the angle and line length?  You will see a lot of people refer you to basic trig, but this isn't accurate because of the dip in the line.  The line holding the kite isnt a straight line.

  
In the past, someone worked out the math using the line length and hyperbolic trig functions.  I can't find it.  Anyone know the formula?

  
Thanks
