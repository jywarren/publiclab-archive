# Have you used the particle atlas? 

It was put out by mccrone labs(a well respected microscopy lab).  The first edition we used was two volumes.  The next edition was four volumes.  Don't know how many volumes it runs now.  It covers microscopes and sample prep as well as providing a set of pictures for comparison.

  
Mccrone used to offer a week long course in microscopy.  Well recommended for particle analysis.  My boss took the course but never could get them to send me.
