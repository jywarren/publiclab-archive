# How do I...use luminescence with the spectrometer?

Many current lab ( as in hospital lab) instruments use bioluminesence or chemoluminescence for quantitation of blood samples.  I think the spectrometer public lab has would also work, but that might involve additional software changes.  Usually, it was integration of peaks over time that was used, similar to chromatography.  But much longer in time.  And sensitivity would depend on the specific "detector"(camera).  Can anyone tell me if using the public labs spectrometer (with bioluminescent modifications)  for the wastewater detection would work you are trying to do?
