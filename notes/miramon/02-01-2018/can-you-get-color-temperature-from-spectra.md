# Can you get color temperature from spectra

If I am correct it is a question of making an algorithm. Having wavelength data it should be possible to calculate color temperature from a spectra from a light source like a led. Most professional spectrometers give a result in Kelvin for color temperature... That would be great for me who am using this spectral workbench for a lighting project.
