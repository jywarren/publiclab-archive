# How can I process the images taken from modified camera?

I have modified the webcam Logitech c920 by removing the IR Filter attached and applying the DIY Infragram red Filter. Here is the results taken :

Am I getting the right results? If not, how could I improve the imagery?   
The next question is, how can I process this images to get NDVI pictures?  Please show me the steps that I need.  

I am currently planning to take aerial imagery using this camera to a farm, and I would like to determine plant's health with this method. Do I need some pre-processing for the images?   

Thank you for your attention sir, any help is appreciated.
