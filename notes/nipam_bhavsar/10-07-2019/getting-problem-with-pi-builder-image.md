# Getting problem with Pi-builder image

Hello Team,

Greetings !!!

Myself is Nipam Bhavsar working as Project Manager in Embedded Firmware in Teksun Microsys located at Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

We are currently working with Raspberry Pi zero W to get the streaming directly in Laptop/PC. We came to know that Pi-builder is good resource which would help us to get camera streaming on our Laptop through RPi hotspot. For that we tried to install pre-built image file from the link([https://gitlab.com/publiclab/pi-builder](https://gitlab.com/publiclab/pi-builder)). After installing when we are going to connect RPi hotspot with Laptop, it is able to connect successfully but we are not getting any option to get the camera streaming.

Hardware Components:

- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Raspberry Pi Camera

Please help us to get resolve this problem. It would be highly appreciated.

Thanks & Regards,

Nipam
