# Air quality egg in my kitchen

I decided to put my egg in the kitchen next to the stove and in my room next to the window. In the kitchen because since the egg will be next to the stove then it would track different amount of particles of content and also humidity. I also wanted the egg in my room because since it's next to the window then the air circulates a lot so it might have a different results.
