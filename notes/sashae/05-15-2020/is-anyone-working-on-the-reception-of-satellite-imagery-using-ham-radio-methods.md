# Is anyone working on the reception of satellite imagery using ham radio methods?

Hello Public Lab community!  

Is anyone working on the reception of satellite imagery using ham radio methods?  

I am a UK based radio amateur interested in decoding weather images from satellites. I wondered whether anyone in the Public Lab community is already exploring or applying ham radio-based methods for weather monitoring and sensing?   

My collaborator, @sophied and I are working on an accessible how-to guide for the reception of NOAA satellites and we'd love to contribute this to Public Lab. If others are already working on these topics or are interested in collaborating do let us know!
