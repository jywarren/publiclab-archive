# Integrating User instructions into the Community Microscope build materials

Hello, I'm Ufuoma! Interning with Public Lab this summer!

  
@warren had a good idea to try and integrate assembly instructions for the community microscope onto the materials themselves by printing words and images. As a reminder, the full assembly instructions can be found [here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/micro).

  
I'm curious how people feel about the readability/usability of these different versions below. Are the instructions confusing? Are certain layouts too cluttered? Are there any instructions that are unnecessary? Any that are missing? Should I use different colors/images? I would love your feedback!![image description](/i/25549.png "Screen_Shot_2018-07-09_at_3.46.53_PM.png")![image description](/i/25550.png "Screen_Shot_2018-07-09_at_3.47.01_PM.png")![image description](/i/25551.png "Screen_Shot_2018-07-09_at_3.47.20_PM.png")![image description](/i/25552.png "Screen_Shot_2018-07-09_at_3.47.42_PM.png")
