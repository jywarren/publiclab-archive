# Spectroscopic gas measurement

Hi everyone, 

  
Please how do I apply spectroscopy to measure ablation species?  I'm using a tungsten calibration lamp for spectrometer calibration in my school.   The major combustion species when hot graphite reacts with air are CO2, CO, and CN. The CN concentration might be negligible within 1000-3500K temperature range. Therefore, I'm looking at measuring the gas concentrations of carbon-monoxide (at 4.7 µm wavelength) and carbon-dioxide (at 4.26 µm wavelength). Please how do I set up the Tungsten Calibration Lamp?
