# Is the webcam from spectrometer v2.0 suitable for the upgrade to 3.0?

###What I want to do or know
I want to know if the webcam from v2.0 is suitable for spectrometer 3.0.
Is there something else to have in account?

I'll remove the DVD piece and install it as described in v3.0.

###Background story
I am [upgrading from spectrometer 2.0 to 3.0 version](https://publiclab.org/notes/pablo/11-09-2016/how-to-do-upgrade-desktop-spectrometer-kit-2-0-to-the-version-3-0?_=1479133825#1.+Remove+webcam+from+desktop+version+2.0,+measure+it+and+prepare+it+to+install+it+in+the+v3.0.).
