# Getting the spectrometer to work with a Raspberry Pi?

I am currently working on creating a program that will go to the spectral workbench page, login, take a spectrum reading, and export the data.  I want this to run in the background and not open a web browser.  I am running this program on a Raspberry PI  2 and am using python as my programming language. 

I tried using the requests module to do this, but I ran into problems.  Are there any good, easy to use modules that can be used for this, or are there any modules that the spectral workbench team would recommend for this? Thanks!
