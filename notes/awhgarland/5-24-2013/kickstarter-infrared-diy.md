# Kickstarter Infrared DIY

Hello,

I attempted to back you with two separate pledges for two separate rewards. Our non profit wants to use the products for several community outreach projects for this coming summer in July, North Slope, AK., and August, Albemarle Region NC. They are youth projects.
Kickstarter does not allow two separate pledges. 
We want the webcam ($35) and the DIY filter ($10) for these summer projects, if you are funded.
We pledged for the webcam and want to pledge for the DIY filer.

Thanks,
Anne Garland
