# Possible sensor for field calibration of photo test strips

These hand held gas detectors are relatively inexpensive, around $200. It could possibly be used to test the relationship between the laboratory exposed strips and a field study. 

It has the potential to record the data of a time span of 24 - 36 months. Allowing the effect of hydrogen sulfide levels to be mapped with variables in the field such as wind, temperature, ect. To determine if this affects the tests.
