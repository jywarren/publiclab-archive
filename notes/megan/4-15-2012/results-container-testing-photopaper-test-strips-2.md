# Results: Container Testing for Photopaper Test Strips #2

Container Test #2
4/1/2012-4/4/4/2012

Results: Designs 1, 2, 5 and 6 were effected least by light. The control was left out in the same location as other containers but in open light. It should be noted that fixing did not eliminate discoloration from light exposure.
