# Question: total beginner problems

###What I want to do or know
I just built up my spectrograph and plugged it into the computer. Problem is, I don't see a real spectrum but only three more or less blue lines. What am I doing wrong? I pointed the device towards diffuse sun light, a candle, a light bulb, and all I am getting are a few blue stripes no yellows, greens or whatever...

###Background story
