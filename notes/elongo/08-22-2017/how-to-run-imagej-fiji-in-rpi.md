# How to run ImageJ, Fiji in RPi?

Hi LaPa,

  
just wondering which steps you followed to setup and run ImageJ and Fiji in your Raspberry Pi.

I am following this [indications of ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Raspberry_Pi#Frequently_Asked_Questions) but documentation is quite loose.

  
Any clues? Thanks.
