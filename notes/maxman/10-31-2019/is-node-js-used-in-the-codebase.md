# Is Node.js used in the codebase?

Hi, I wanted to know whether Public Lab uses Node.js in any of its projects such as Plots2, Mapknitter, SpectralWorkbench.org, etc. as mentioned on the organization page of Google Code-In 2019\. Github repositories show that they majorly use Ruby on Rails for the backend part so please clarify
