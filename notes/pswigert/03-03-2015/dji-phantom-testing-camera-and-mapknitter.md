# DJI Phantom- Testing Camera and Mapknitter

As part of a research project I'm working on at UC Berkeley I'm exploring opportunities for sharing and collaborating on aerial imagery, obviously something Public Lab has lots of experience with.

I'm particularly interested in how commercially available quadcopters/drones will open up opportunities for aerial imagery (nothing against the kites and balloons Public Lab supports and has used effectively, those are clearly more valuable in certain use cases).

Here I just was learning to fly a DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ and wanted to test out how easy it was to take downward facing images, what quality they would be and then how to stitch them together via Mapknitter.

A couple lessons learned- it's easy with the Phantom to take photos that aren't 100% straight down. Need to make sure that toggle is fully adjusted. Also, the fisheye effect can get fairly pronounced; the crossing paths highlight it here. Post-processing to remove that seems pretty valuable if I really wanted a crisp set of images.
