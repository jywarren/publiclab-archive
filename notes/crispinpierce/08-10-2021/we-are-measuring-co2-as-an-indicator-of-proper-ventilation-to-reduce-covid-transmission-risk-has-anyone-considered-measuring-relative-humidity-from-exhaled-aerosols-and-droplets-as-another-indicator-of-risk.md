# We are measuring CO2 as an indicator of proper ventilation to reduce COVID transmission risk. Has anyone considered measuring relative humidity (from exhaled aerosols and droplets) as another indicator of risk?

We're interested in measuring classroom ventilation to control COVID transmission risk. While this virus (like other respiratory viruses) appears to be less viable in more humid atmospheres, these conditions are also caused by breath exhalation (gym windows and mirrors fogging up). Could measurement of increases in relative humidity indoors reflect inadequate ventilation?
