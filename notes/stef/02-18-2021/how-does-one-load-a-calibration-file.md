# how does one load a calibration file?

i have a spectrometer that came pre calibrated with a /csv calibration  file, I can calibrate a spectra and it is aready calibrated when SW receives it The spectra that  I have  now in SW is identified by the header Thunder Spect 1 xxxx it has a SMA type fiber input A Sony IMX linear cmos sensor 100um slit 1000 L/mm grating  USB connection Manufacturer Thunder Optics I have not as yet looked under the hood. Assume V2 of SW is currently being used?
