# SW-V1 down samples the input to 256 samples irrespective of the native  camera pixels available has this been fixed in V2?

Limiting the input to SW-V2 to 256 pixels, ignores the advances made in camera sensor technologies. Are there plans to rectify this  deficiency as we now have camera sensors greater than 8,13.5 and greater to improve the spectral perfomance of SW . There also have been advances made in camera opyics as used previously.
