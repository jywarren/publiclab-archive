# Is there a predictive relationship between the number of PM 2.5 and smaller airborne particulates compared to the mass of the same ug per cubic meter?

Today's cost effective particle counters measure PM 2.5 and PM 10\. PM 2.5 and smaller are the greatest health risk. Is there a way to take the measurement of the mass of PM 2.5 in micrograms per cubic meter and extrapolate an approximate number of total airborne particles at PM 2.5 and smaller? For example, could we know that a 2.0 ug per m3 has approximately 20M PM 2.5 and below particles and 1 ug per m3 would then have 10M?
