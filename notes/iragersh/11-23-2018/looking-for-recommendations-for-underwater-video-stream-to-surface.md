# Looking for recommendations for underwater video stream to surface

I would like to view video above water taken by a camera that is underwater.  To do this I would need a tethered camera because WIFI does not go through water.  Tethered video systems that work underwater tend to be super expensive.  I'm looking for something under $100\.  I have a GoPro with a waterproof case and a WiFi addition to it.  There is a hack to use capture the WiFi and then view it on a phone.  I have been unable to make the hack work.  If you have been able to do this or know of an inexpensive alternative, I would like to know.
