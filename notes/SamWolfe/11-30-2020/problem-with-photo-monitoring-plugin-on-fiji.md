# Problem with Photo Monitoring Plugin on Fiji

I have Fiji version "fiji-win64-20141125\_PM" and installed manually the four plugins successfully:   
metadata-extractor-2.6.2.jar  
Photo\_Monitoring.jar  
sanselan-0.97-incubator.jar  
xmpcore.jar  
  
Then when I run Fiji software I canÂ´t see into Plugins Tab the Photo Monitoring option.  

Can someone can tell me how I enable the "Photo Monitoring" option on Plugins tab?

Do I need to install additional plugins? If so where they are?![image description](/i/41857.jpg "Fiji_Issue_01.jpg")

  
Thanks!
