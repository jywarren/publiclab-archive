###What I want to do
Write a series of research notes covering the weekend at Phats Valley Residency: the visible imagery, the Infragram imagery, site characteristics, planned development, logistics, the history, and dinner on the beach.  For now, just an outline.

The organizers of the Phats Valley Residency wanted to explore the marsh in detail through making a map of the area and foraging a hyperlocal feast.  

###Our attempt and results
####Day 1: Kite: Cloudy, High Winds

Ann, Davey, Sam, Don & I tested the wind from the abandoned railroad bed in the middle of the marsh.

We had some setbacks.

This is worse than it looks.

####Day 2: Balloon: Partly cloudy to full sun, stable winds

###Questions and next steps
Day 1 was about exploring the area and getting acclimated.  Day 2 was highly productive.  We grabbed a lot of images, hiked around the marsh, and found tasty food.

The big red balloon brought out the curiousity of the community.  We started lots of conversations on what we were doing and what might happen next in the marsh.  Some talks were about the abundant oysters at the southern breach at the railroad.  Others were about the plans for anticipated changes to the road crossings adding further changes to the marsh.  
####Oysters at the Railroad Breach

In this location, riprap & construction material seem to provide an excellent substrate for oyster restoration.  More data is needed.

####Three marshes

A freshwater marsh to the left of the house and Pamet Marsh split by the railroad bed.  

We have many maps to make.
