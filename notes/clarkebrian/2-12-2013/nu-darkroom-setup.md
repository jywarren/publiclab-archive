# NU Darkroom Setup

Today Sara and I set up a darkroom at Northeastern University.  We prepared fixer in order to make a batch of hydrogen sulfide sensing strips using photographic paper. 
Fixer is diluted in a 1:10 ratio with water.  Fill graduated measuring cup to bottom line with fixer, fill cup to second line with water.
To check viability of fixer, add a few drops of hypo-chek.  If solution is cloudy, fixer is no longer usable.
Fixer is hazardous waste and must be labeled as such and disposed of in the waste container.
