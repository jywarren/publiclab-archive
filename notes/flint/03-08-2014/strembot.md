# Strembot

###What I have done
Arduino based low cost remote stream gauge
see presentation[][(http://docbox.flint.com/~flint/strembot_presentation/img0.html)

###My attempt and results
http://strembot.org/

###Questions and next steps
Breakthrough is getting good resolution out of depth sensor strip.
follow progress on http://strembot.org/ tiddlewiki

###Why I'm interested
NOAA and USGS are closing gauge houses nationally.  We need to know the water depth and
be able to deprive flow from this data.
