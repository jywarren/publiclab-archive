# Testing Water For Specific Polluting Compounds

###What I want to do or know

Hey everyone, 
I was hoping to ask those of you prototyping if there is any quick way to measure for any of the following compounds:

1-naphthol, naphthalene, Sevin, tarry residue, mercury, toxic organochlorines, volatile organochlorine compounds, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, hexachloroethane, hexachlorobutadiene, or the pesticide HCH.

Thank you in advance for your help!

best,

Rajan
