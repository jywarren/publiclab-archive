# I want to know a method to quantify milk proteins (cow milk, almond milk, coconut milk, oat milk) using the foldable mini spectrometer, Is this possible?

I am a high school student and this is my research project for the IB and I basically want to know if this is possible and in case it is, do I need to dilute the milk? How should I do it? Can I get quantified results out of it? Can I do it with a CFL bulb?

Thank you very much!
