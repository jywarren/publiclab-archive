# Bug : Impossible to calibrate this mercury vapour spectrum

Where can I report this?

The blue bar appears to need to be negative, and the calibration is therefore not stored.[https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/136374](https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/136374)

Is there a way of adding a calibration with user-defined calibration positions?

404.7 - H-line - violet

435.8 - G-line - blue

546.1 - green 

578.2 - yellow-orange
