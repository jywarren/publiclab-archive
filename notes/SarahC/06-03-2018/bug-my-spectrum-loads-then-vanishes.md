# Bug? My Spectrum loads then vanishes.

I forked one of my broken spectrums here:

https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/136078  

  
It appears fine.

  
But when I try and view this page - the spectrum image shows briefly, and then when the chart appears underneath - the chart is empty, and the spectrum image vanishes!

Is this some strange bug?
