# How do I convert the data received from my the processed Infragram into a unit? (mg/L of chlorophyll?)

Hello!

  
I'm doing an experiment where I'm trying to measure chlorophyll content in plants. I was wondering if I could convert the Infragram data into a unit of measure for the chlorophyll? I am using the Raspberry Pi NoIR camera and infragram.org for the post-processing.

  
Thanks in advance!
