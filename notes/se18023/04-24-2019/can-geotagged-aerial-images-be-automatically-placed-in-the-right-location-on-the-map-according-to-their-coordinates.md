# Can geotagged aerial images be automatically placed in the right location on the map according to their coordinates?

I have aerial imagery which I want to stitch together to make a map. The images are geotagged with the coordinates of their location. I watched a tutorial video for mapknitter that said images would be able to place themselves on the map in the right location according to their coordinates
