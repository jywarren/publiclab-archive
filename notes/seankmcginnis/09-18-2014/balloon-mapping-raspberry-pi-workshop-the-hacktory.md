# Balloon Mapping & Raspberry Pi Workshop @ The Hacktory

#### Workshop Details
This workshop will be held as part of [The Hactory's](http://www.thehacktory.org) fall workshop series on October 18th from 1p to 4p. We will be discussing basic balloon/kite and pole mapping as well as more detailed conversations about using a Raspberry Pi as a sensor base to capture more information during your session.

You can register for the [here](https://thehacktory.ticketleap.com/balloon-mapping-with-raspberry-pi/dates/Oct-18-2014_at_0100PM), but space is limited to 12, so if you are interested please register early.

#### Workshop Description
Balloons, kites and poles are low cost, easy to use and safe methods for collecting aerial images and making maps. Aerial images are usually collected using satellites and airplanes, but these ground-based approaches provide an on-demand alternative to collect information when events or environmental conditions are occurring. This workshop will discuss grassroots mapping, lessons learned from the larger balloon mapping community, the components of a mapping kit and how you can get started.
