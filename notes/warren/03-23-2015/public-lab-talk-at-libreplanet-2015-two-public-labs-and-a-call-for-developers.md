# Public Lab talk at LibrePlanet 2015: Two Public Labs, and a call for developers

I gave a 10 minute lightning talk at LibrePlanet 2015 this past Saturday, where I discussed the idea that there are "two Public Labs" -- an idea explored in [this piece I co-wrote](/notes/liz/02-10-2015/valuing-two-modes-of-public-lab-activities) with Liz Barry (@liz), and also made an explicit call for new software contributors for our major web platforms. It was a great event -- so great to see out of town friends! -- and of course thanks to [Molly DeBlanc](https://mmillions.wordpress.com/) (who happens to be a [Public Lab Supporting Member!](http://publiclab.org/donate)) for organizing the talks.
