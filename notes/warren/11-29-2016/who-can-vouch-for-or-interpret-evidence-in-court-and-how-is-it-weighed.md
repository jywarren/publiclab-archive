# Who can vouch for, or interpret, evidence in court, and how is it weighed?

This is a followup question from last week's [blog post on photographic evidence in court](https://publiclab.org/n/13716). 

Chris Nidel cites an example where data was **collected** by a non-professional scientist, but interpreting data in court is distinct. Who gets to be an expert witness and what qualifies them for it?
