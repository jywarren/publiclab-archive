# Document your hardware upgrades at Parts & Crafts Documentation Days - Oct 12 & 19

With all the great progress on our new [Activities system](/tag/activity-grids), folks are [starting to upgrade their starter kits](https://publiclab.org/tag/upgrade:*), especially the [Desktop Spectrometry Starter Kit](https://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0) (see [below](#Upgrades) for a list of posted upgrades!)

So in conjunction with [OSHWA's Documentation Days](http://www.oshwa.org/2016/09/12/documentation-days-host-your-own/) all October, [Parts & Crafts](http://partsandcrafts.org) here in Somerville, MA is hosting 4 documentation days, and we'll be hosting tables at **two of them** -- on the 12th and the 19th:

### Spectrometry upgrading

If you have a Desktop Spectrometry Starter Kit and want to upgrade it and help in the documentation/replication effort, come on by ([RSVP here](https://www.amilia.com/store/en/parts-and-crafts/shop/activities/1179365?date=2016-10-05&view=month) but appreciated.
)! And if you're not local, post your replications and upgrade builds remotely! 

We'll be working in particular on the new [stability upgrade](https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/09-16-2016/stability-upgrade-mockup-for-plab-spectrometer-3-0) by @stoft and the [ambient light upgrade](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-22-2016/reduce-interior-reflections-in-your-spectrometer-with-black-ink) by myself! 

We'll have the needed materials (black ink, glue, wood blocks) available, so bring your kit and we'll give it an overhaul -- similarly to how we [replicated these upgrades at LEAFFEST](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-20-2016/building-the-stoft-stability-upgrade-for-desktop-spectrometry-starter-kit-3-0):
