# Help us refine the search interface at PublicLab.org/search

Hi, we're starting a series of user interface design projects (on [this page](https://publiclab.org/ui), check them out!), and one of them that's upcoming is for our "advanced search" pages. A LOT of work during the past summer's Rails Girls Summer of Code (#rgsoc) went into overhauling our search code, and we are in a great position to now begin working on lots of detailed refinements on top of that foundation.

### What kind of feedback?

Here's an example: when I visit [http://publiclab.org/search](http://publiclab.org/search) and enter something and press enter, I feel like it's not responding. Maybe I expect to see a spinner or some feedback that my search has "begun":

So, what I want to note is:

1. what I saw that I felt could be better (an observation)
2. the goal I want to achieve (feedback that the site is doing something)
3. an idea for improvement (a spinner icon!)

Using this framework, what are some observations and suggestions for how we can improve our search page at [https://publiclab.org/search/](https://publiclab.org/search/) ?

Thank you for helping to make [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org) a better place!
