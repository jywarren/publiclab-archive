# Proposal: SLR spectrometer attachment

Lots of folks have talked about doing a higher-end spectrometer attachment based on an SLR lens mount. This is a good idea -- we can model it and share the model on Shapeways so people can 3D print it. 

To start out with, I did a quick survey of open source Thingiverse models of camera lens mounts and lens caps:

* Lens adaptor for tilt-shift, for Canon EOS cameras: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36173
* Canon 51mm inner diameter lens cap: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:110870
* 50mm Canon EF extension tube: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74217

One thing I'm not sure about -- will take some testing -- is whether we want to make an attachment for the front of a lens -- lens-cap style -- or to attach directly to the body of the camera, which would have no lens. I'm not sure the latter would work with [our current spectrometer design](/wiki/spectrometer)... the geometry may be pretty different. I also don't have an SLR :-P
