# Using the HITRAN database for spectral analysis

I'm really curious about our ability to identify methane and other gases with DIY spectroscopy in some form. I found this database of absorbances for various gases: 

http://hitran.iao.ru/molecule

To quickly see what it provides, see this graph i generated on the site, for methane:

The whole site is organized by wavenumber, which is the inverse of wavelength. (easy online converter: http://www.impublications.com/convert.php)
