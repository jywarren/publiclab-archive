# Is there a water quality equivalent of Smoke School, the EPA air pollution observer certification?

###What I want to do or know

Folks have been [really interested in monitoring water quality visually](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-waterquality/i_j_QsDql88) -- through photos or direct visual observing. @liz and @mathew posted [some resources](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-waterquality/ej0sUb_gJtI) on Smoke School (#smoke-school):

> **Mathew:** Is visual observation effective means of reporting air pollution to the EPA? have their been successes using the EPA visual assessment standards?
> @gretchengehrke found a 1993 EPA guide to visual assessment of emissions:

> and a quick one-pager on stop-watch based fugitive emissions reporting:

> **Liz:** have you ever heard of Smoke School? It's training that observers can get that the EPA will respond to: http://smokeschoolinc.com/ 

I believe that's called [Method 9](https://publiclab.org/wiki/visual-pm#Smoke+School+Certification) (and related methods). 

I'm curious (reposting this note from [the water quality list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-waterquality/ej0sUb_gJtI)) -- is there any equivalent method for people to visually observe and report water quality issues, like visible contamination or plumes, to the EPA? 

@pdhixenbaugh mentioned some on that thread -- would you mind adding those in here as a resource? Thanks!
