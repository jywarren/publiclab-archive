# New PublicLab.org website launched

###A brand new website!

Hello all -- you've probably been hearing about this process on some of the lists, but we've just switched over our default website to the new and shiny 2.0 site. 

Notably, all [PublicLaboratory.org](http://PublicLaboratory.org) URLs should now redirect you to [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org)!

###Troubleshooting

We've tested this a good bit, but if you have trouble, PLEASE reply to this message (even "me too!" responses are helpful to assess if it's a systematic problem). There may be some lurking bugs (fingers crossed, but you never know) so look out! If you're feeling extra helpful, [you can report bugs here](/wiki/issues).

###Legacy site and next steps

If you still need features from the old site, you can still access it at: [old.publiclab.org](http://old.publiclab.org). The new site, [which you can read about here](/wiki/plots2), will continue to be improved and refined in coming weeks. Stay tuned and thanks for making Public Lab an amazing community!

Thanks!

_the Public Lab staff and the Web Working Group_
