# "Test images" for multispectral image processing

Hi, all - talking with some collaborators, I'm interested in collecting a set of test images to validate different software for infrared/visible analysis, such as with the #infragram project, the [Photo Monitoring Plugin](/wiki/photo-monitoring-plugin), and various other approaches, like Photoshop or Gimp-based methods:

https://publiclab.org/wiki/ndvi#Activities

Basically, what are some good "before and after" images that could show an image before and after NDVI compositing? 

With these, we can "run" NDVI using any of the above software, and compare what the program makes to the expected "after" image to confirm that it works. These would also make for really good examples of what NDVI and other composites actually do!

This is particularly useful for @ccpandhare's project `image-sequencer` -- his summer project, which will perform NDVI among other things:

Thanks!
