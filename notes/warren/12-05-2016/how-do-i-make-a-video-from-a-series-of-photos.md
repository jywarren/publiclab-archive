# How do I make a video from a series of photos?

### What I want to do or know

Is there an easy way to make a timelapse video out of a series of images, like from a #trail-camera?

### Background story

Chris made a great video from photos from a #trail-cam in his post on our #leaffest timelapse tests:

And was asking others to upload some of their timelapses in this thread:

I wanted to know what the easiest/cheapest way to do this is, so others can share their images the same way.
