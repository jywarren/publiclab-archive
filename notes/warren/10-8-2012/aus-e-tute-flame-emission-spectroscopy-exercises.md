# Aus-e-tute flame emission spectroscopy exercises

This website has a few very nice introductions and activities for flame emission spectroscopy, and outlines a methodology as part of a test prep activity. They're copyrighted, but the underlying methodology seems to be a standard approach, but presented in a clear and concise manner.

There's also one on atomic absorption (AA) spectroscopy, a variant which may be interesting to us.
