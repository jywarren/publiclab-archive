# "543" Landsat band colors - using mid-infrared to detect "permeable" surfaces

Thanks to [Diane Styers](/people/diane) for this note. The 5, 4, and 3 bands of the Landsat satellite are a common combination for assessing the permeability of surfaces, for example in a city. This can help assess drainage, heat-island, and agricultural issues.
