# Spectrometer slit width thoughts

###What I want to do

I'd like to propose a couple changes to the optical slit based on observations. The slit is fantastically precise but for low-light uses I found it hard to get enough light to the sensor. I was thinking that a considerably wider option for slit might really be helpful in the kit. So:

* wider slit options
* printing the width next to the slit or at its edge so its easy to tell which it is. Off the right or left edge so it doesn't interfere with readings. 

Also I was thinking of how we might use tags to mark some research notes as "proposed improvements" to kits? That could be interesting.
