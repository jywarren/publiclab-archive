# What are different ways to collect respirable dust samples for analysis?

I've seen filters, swabs, sticky pads... what are some options, and pros/cons of each type? 

  
In particular, what is the easiest way to collect a sample, if you're looking for something like 3-5 micron particles of respirable silica?
