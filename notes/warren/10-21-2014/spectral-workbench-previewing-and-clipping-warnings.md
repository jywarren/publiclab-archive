# Spectral Workbench previewing and clipping warnings

Just a quick update here - I added a webcam preview to the capture interface (see above) as well as a combined RGB graph so you can see clipping more easily. It also marks clipping (overexposure) in yellow to warn you. 

Finally, there's a "centroid detection" feature which tracks the center of area under the curve, a metric which we're using in oil grading: http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/09-23-2014/graded-oils-using-uv-fluorescence
