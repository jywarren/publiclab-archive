# Squid Week at Public Lab!

Since we declared this week Kite Week on Twitter ([https://twitter.com/PublicLab/status/879687098844008448](https://twitter.com/PublicLab/status/879687098844008448)) I wanted to share a few pictures of the new kites that will be part of the [Mini Kite Kits](/wiki/mini-kite-kit) on our new Kickstarter campaign:

Please share your own, they're a lot of fun!

I just sent one to the New Orleans Public Lab office, and here's @bronwen with one on the roof of Pfizer in Brooklyn:
