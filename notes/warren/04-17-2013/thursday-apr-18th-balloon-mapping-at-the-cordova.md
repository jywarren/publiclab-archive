> This Thursday the 18th at the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum in Lincoln, Jane Marsching and I are going to be doing some balloon photography as part of our Field Station Concordia project. It's aimed at kids on April vacation, but should be fun for all.

> Stop by anytime between 1 and 3pm. There will be other activities taking place around the grounds as well.
