# Learn to kite map a marsh: an October 21st workshop at Tidmarsh Farms

Hi, folks - in response to Glorianna Davenport's [request for help](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-19-2017/request-for-kite-balloon-mapping-help-at-tidmarsh-farms-wetlands-restoration-in-plymouth-ma) in taking aerial photos of the amazing wetlands restoration project going on at **Tidmarsh Farms** (in Plymouth, Massachusetts), I'll be doing a hands-on kite-mapping workshop. If you'd like to learn how to take photos from a kite, and to try it out yourself, please reach out -- and come join in! You can see some of our past work there under the #tidmarsh tag.

I'll have everything we'll need: string, kites, cameras, but if you want to bring your own kite or gear, please do! 

  
Glorianna has asked folks to [please RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOY2hQD30DKy5dduyfLKVUINVfSNZ4eJakvkU9OVkx5UQaZA/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

Tidmarsh Wildlife Sanctuary is at **137 Bartlett Road, Plymouth, MA 02360**
