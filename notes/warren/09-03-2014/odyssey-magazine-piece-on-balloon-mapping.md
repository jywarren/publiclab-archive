# Odyssey magazine piece on Balloon Mapping

Odyssey Magazine is a kids science magazine, and they ran a whole issue on remote sensing recently which featured a 3-page spread on balloon mapping. It's great -- encourages people to join Public Lab, clearly cites and attributes, and is a fun layout too. Nice!
