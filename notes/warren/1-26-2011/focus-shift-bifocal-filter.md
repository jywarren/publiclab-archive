# Focus shift in bifocal filter?

Does this image show focus shift? It seems like the infrared is in focus while the visible is not. 

see http://www.apogeephoto.com/mag1-4/mag1-4mfir.shtml for a discussion:

"light waves of different wavelengths do not focus on the same plane when passing through a simple lens"

This may be a good reason not to use the bifocal filter system as we're currently prototyping with the [Near-Infrared Camera](/tool/near-infrared-camera). An alternative is the [Stereo Camera](/tool/stereo-camera) using two synchronized cameras on the same balloon.
