# Make a simple mylar/trash bag delta kite

At [Parts & Crafts](http://partsandcrafts.org) we designed and built a quick and very lightweight delta kite with a wingspan of about 9 feet. We didn't measure anything except the 90 degree angle for the nose, and it flew pretty well! We'll be using it this week for some aerial photography. Photos of flight below.
