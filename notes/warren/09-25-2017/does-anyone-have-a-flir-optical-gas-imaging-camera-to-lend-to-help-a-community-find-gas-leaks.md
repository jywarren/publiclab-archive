# Does anyone have a FLIR Optical Gas Imaging camera to lend to help a community find gas leaks?

From [Toxics Action Center](https://toxicsaction.org), @clairebwmiller is asking on behalf of a community that's trying to identify gas leaks in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) tanks nearby, and they're interested in the cameras listed here:

> FLIR optical gas imaging (OGI) cameras can help you detect methane, sulfur hexafluoride, and hundreds of other industrial gases quickly, accurately, and safely - without shutting down systems. With FLIR OGI cameras, you can scan broad sections of equipment rapidly and survey areas that are hard to reach with traditional contact measurement tools. OGI cameras can also detect leaks from a safe distance, displaying these invisible gases as clouds of smoke.

The cameras FLIR offers that can do this include:

> FLIR GFx320, GF320, GF300, and G300a
