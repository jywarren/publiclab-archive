# What gases can a FLIR GasFinder (OGI) infrared camera detect?

According to http://www.flir.com/ogi/,  

> FLIR received third-party validation of the FLIR GFx320, GF320, GF300, and G300a cameras' compliance with the following sensitivity standard laid out by the EPA in the NSPS OOOOa methane rule:
> Your optical gas imaging equipment must be capable of imaging a gas that is half methane, half propane at a concentration of 10,000 ppm at a flow rate of â‰¤60g/hr from a quarter inch diameter orifice.

They have a certificate and webinar training course posted on the above site. Their cameras can detect:

* METHANE (CH4) / NATURAL GAS 
* AMMONIA (NH3) 
* BENZENE (C6H6) 
* CARBON MONOXIDE (CO) 
* ETHYL ALCOHOL (C2H5OH) 
* HYDROCARBONS / OLEFINS 
* HYDROGEN (H2) / CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) 
* PROPANE (C3H8) / BUTANE (C4H10)
* PROPYLENE (C3H6) 
* REFRIGERANTS / R-134A (CH2FCF3) 
* SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE (SF6)
* TRICHLOROETHYLENE (C2HCL3) 
* VINYL CHLORIDE MONOMER (C2H3CL)
