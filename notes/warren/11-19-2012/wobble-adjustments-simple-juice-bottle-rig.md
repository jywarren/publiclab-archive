# Wobble adjustments for simple juice bottle rig

I've been loving my juice bottle rigs recently because they're extra compact, really solid (the soda bottles used to crush a bit) and they keep the camera pointed really straight down in the bottle (soda bottles can allow the camera to slide to one side during flight sometimes).

However, Mathew and Stewart seemed a little skeptical after the barnraising when my rig shook a bit on kite flights -- and I realized the attachment point is a bit too close to the center of mass of the rig, causing a certain jumpiness. This could be why we had some blurriness in the [Tidmarsh Farms flights on Saturday](/notes/warren/11-18-2012/tidmarsh-farms-mapping-meetup-success). I tried tying another point onto the tail to make a kind of inverted Y-shape, and it seems to stabilize things quite a bit. 

This rig is not meant to be the best ever -- just the fastest & simplest to make, and the most foolproof. I'm extra happy with it now that the wobble is likely to be much reduced. Check out the video:
