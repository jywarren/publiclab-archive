# Pros/cons to cheap handheld water meters for pH, TDS, conductivity?

While buying parts for the #knowflow sensor collection, I saw some pretty affordable <$20 sensors on Amazon:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FPG89CE/  

  
Do people have experience with these, know about their limitations, or has anyone compared them to, for example, [DF Robot's collection of sensors](https://www.dfrobot.com/search-water%20quality.html) that connect to Arduino?
