# Illustrated guide to spectrometer construction

Because of the popularity of our [illustrated guide to balloon mapping](/guides), which also ships in our retail kits, I spent some time making the attached 2-page PDF showing how to construct a spectrometer. It doesn't cover how to use it, and focuses on specifically how the current [spectrometer kit](http://shop.breadpig.com/collections/publiclaboratory/products/desktop-spectrometry-kit) is made (i.e. a particular webcam), but aside from being useful to ship in the kits, I imagine we can continue to expand and revise it as we did the original balloon mapping guide.

Here is the PDF (1.4 MB): [PLOTS DIY Spectrometer Guide v1.0.pdf](https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/PLOTS%20DIY%20Spectrometer%20Guide%20v1.0.pdf)
