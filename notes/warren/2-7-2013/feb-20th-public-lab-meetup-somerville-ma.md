# Feb 20th Public Lab meetup in Somerville MA

We're hoping to have a chance for Public Lab folks to meet, discuss their projects, and possibly plan upcoming Public Lab events. The meetup will be on the evening of **Wednesday, Feb 20**:

* 7pm at [440 Somerville Ave, Somerville](http://goo.gl/maps/k9eZO) (known as [the "pirateship"](http://where.irateship.com))
* we will post a sign on the door (it is in an alley next to Market Basket, same building as India Market, see above)

**Please leave a comment here if you are planning on coming!**

Everyone's welcome to present their work, as well -- maybe comment here as well if you'd' like to.
