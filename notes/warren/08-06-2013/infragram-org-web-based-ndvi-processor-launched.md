# Infragram.org web-based NDVI processor launched

Although many folks are using [Ned Horning](/profile/nedhorning)'s [Photo Monitoring Plugin](/wiki/photo-monitoring-plugin) to post-process their photos, we have also just launched (through lots of hard work by [Don Blair](/profile/donblair) and [Craig Versek](/profile/cversek) of [Pioneer Valley Open Science](http://pvos.org)) an easy-to-use website for processing your Infragram photos. 

Check it out at [Infragram.org](http://infragram.org), and [on Github](https://github.com/Pioneer-Valley-Open-Science/infrapix-flask/)! (but beware -- it's a beta!)
