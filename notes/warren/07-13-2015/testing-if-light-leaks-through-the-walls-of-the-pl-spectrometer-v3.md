# Testing if light leaks through the walls of the PL Spectrometer v3

Following up on [a note on possible light going through the black cardstock walls of the v3 spectrometer](/notes/lukebrown/07-11-2015/desktop-spectrometry-kit-v3-for-vnir-field-spectroscopy) by @lukebrown

Luke said it mostly happened in bright sunlight, but also indoors. I just did a test in (admittedly cloudy) sunlight vs. closing the blinds, and covering the device with a thick blanket, and didn't see a big difference. It doesn't seem likely to me that light is leaking in through this big dark folded-over blanket. How does this compare to your noise, @lukebrown? Is it possible you have a small light leak as opposed to it going through the paper itself? I'm just trying to reproduce the issue first.
