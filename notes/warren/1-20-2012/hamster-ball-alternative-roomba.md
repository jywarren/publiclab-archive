# "Hamster ball" alternative to Roomba

Weird idea but i ordered a hamster ball ($4) and am going to try building it. It naturally rolls around and navigates around objects, and could be lit up from the inside. These usually have air holes for the hamster, which would let the sensor "smell" the outside air.
