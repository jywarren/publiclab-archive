# Planning for Spectral Workbench 2.0

Hello [Spectral Workbench](https://spectralworkbench.org) community! 

**Do you wish you could do more with Spectral Workbench?**

**Do you have trouble with a particular feature or recurring bug?**

In coming weeks we'll be beginning a major revamp for Spectral Workbench, similar to the scale of the recent work on MapKnitter 2. Towards that end, and because [SW is open source software](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench), we're asking everyone to consider making suggestions for new features, bugfixes, refinements, etc. -- and to help prioritize these so that we can decide what to do first.

In the comments below, please offer suggestions and ask questions! Please provide:

* a succinct description of the thing you'd like
* a description of your problem if applicable
* a few words of context for why you think this is important
* (optional) suggestions for how to implement such a fix, or how it might be designed
