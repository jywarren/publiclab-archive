# What are easy and fast ways to get files off a Raspberry Pi?

Discussing in https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-20-2019/set-up-a-raspberry-pi-camera-with-pi-builder#c25090, we realized the (second) disk partition that contains images in our standard #pi-builder software (used in the #pi-camera, #infragram-pi, and #lego-spectrometer projects) doesn't just show up as a disk in either Mac OS X or Windows 7\. 

  
@icarito maybe you have some ideas?
