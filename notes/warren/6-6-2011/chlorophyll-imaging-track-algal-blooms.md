# Chlorophyll imaging to track algal blooms

Another nice image from [the paper by C. Silva, T. A. DelValls and M.L. Martín-Díaz titled "Environmental monitoring and mapping in a tidal salt marsh creek affected by fish aquaculture using Worldview-2 multispectral imagery"](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/6-6-2011/using-multispectral-imagery-derive-bathymetry) - this one depicting algal blooms using the chlorophyll-a band of the NASA MODIS sensor. 

Notice the low resolution (250m, i think? maybe 1km?) of the MODIS imagery. WorldView 2 can do a few meters, but we're doing (in near-infrared) a few centimeters. We've got to do a test measuring algal blooms soon.
