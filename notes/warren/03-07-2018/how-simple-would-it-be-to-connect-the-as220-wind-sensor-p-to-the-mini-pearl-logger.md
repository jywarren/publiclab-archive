# How simple would it be to connect the AS220 wind sensor P to the Mini Pearl Logger?

I'm hoping to get a simple wind sensor together for classroom kite logging with the #aren project.

I know @cfastie has done some great work on the #as220 wind sensor here, based on [the Mini Pearl Snap kit](http://kaptery.com/product/mini-pearl-snap-logger-kit):

And perhaps connected to this question: [https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/09-30-2017/how-do-we-get-data-off-of-different-wind-sensors](https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/09-30-2017/how-do-we-get-data-off-of-different-wind-sensors)

Thanks!
