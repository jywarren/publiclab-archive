# Challenges, questions and problem-solving together: choosing cameras for Mini Balloon and Kite Kits

Thanks for a terrific first week of [our Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/kickstarter-gold-balloon-mapping-kits/)! 47% in our first seven days is awesome -- thanks for your support.  

We often talk about how Public Lab is dedicated to collaborative work, and we've mentioned that the new Mini Balloon and Kite Kits are "**prototyping kits**" -- but we want to get the ball rolling on what exactly we're hoping to collaboratively prototype.

So we'll be announcing "challenges" or "unknowns" that we're inviting folks to chip in their thoughts on -- and if you're already a mapper, to try out yourself.

We'd also love it if people would post their **questions, ideas, and challenges**, so we can collect them and help get this collaboration going. That's how Public Lab works -- and I wanted to mention that we've been doing this in person as well; at the **Appalachia** **Barnraising** (read more [about these Public Lab events here](https://publiclab.org/barnraising)) this past weekend, we spent a morning testing out these new kits in Morgantown, West Virginia (lead image).

Online, we've already begun collecting basic information about the kits at these pages on the Public Lab site:

Each has a "**Questions**" area where you can post your questions, and we've started things off with a few already.

### First challenge: choosing cameras!

For today, we want to break the ice with a discussion of weight -- these balloons can lift over 60 grams each, which means that on a perfectly calm day, you can lift [one of these GoPro alternatives](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-20-2017/cheap-lightweight-gopro-alternatives-for-aerial-mapping). But what are the best options?

Have you tried these cameras out? Know of something cheaper, lighter, or better resolution? Of course we've done some preliminary testing, but we're also on the lookout for more lightweight cameras. [Tell us what you know!](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-20-2017/cheap-lightweight-gopro-alternatives-for-aerial-mapping)![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/020/927/large/IMG_20170605_225015_724-2.jpg "IMG_20170605_225015_724-2.jpg")
