# What kinds of toxins can be filtered by plants, and how do we know?

[This page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/diy-indoor-air-quality-remediation-kit) mentions various studies and [this activity](https://publiclab.org/notes/nshapiro/09-26-2016/build-a-plant-based-air-purifier) lists plants that can be used, but what types of toxins does this apply to, and to what degree?

Thanks!
