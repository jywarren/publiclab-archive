# What should we be recording in balloon/kite mapping logbooks?

I put up this call for input on a [collaboratively-written Pocket Guide to Grassroots Mapping](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-01-2017/collaboratively-write-the-new-pocket-guide-to-grassroots-mapping) last week, and you might notice that the end of the booklet is a set of "logbook entry forms" that (for now) look like this:

I asked for:

  
- date
- location
- collaborators (attribution!)
- conditions
- windspeed
- wind direction (the "compass rose")
- any extra notes

What else might we provide space or prompts for when you go out and map? One idea was that we could provide a unique code to write onto your SD card, or even a place to tape your SD card onto the logbook page -- what are your ideas?
