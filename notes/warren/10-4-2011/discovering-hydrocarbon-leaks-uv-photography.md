# Discovering hydrocarbon leaks with UV photography?

Wow, great insider info on identifying hydrocarbon leaks from ultraviolet photography... thanks NASA and the Society of Exploration Geophysicists!

> When the Patrick Draw field was overflown by an airborne UV sensor, this map of fluorescence anomalies was constructed; these results seem to confirm detectability of hydrocarbon-related gases at or above surfaces where leakage of the gases occurs: [shown above]
 
> Two discoveries stemming from the Geosat study of Patrick Draw are significant: 1) a map of lineaments shows microseeps at several intersections, and 2) there is a distinct geobotanical anomaly in and near Patrick Draw - sage plants are damaged, presumably by escaping hydrocarbons, and this is detectable in hyperspectral imagery. Unfortunately, key illustrations supporting this have not been made public.
