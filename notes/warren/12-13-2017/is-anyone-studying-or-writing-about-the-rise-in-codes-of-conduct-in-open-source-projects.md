# Is anyone studying or writing about the rise in Codes of Conduct in open source projects?

I just posted a short piece on codes of conduct as relate to software outreach -- and I've seen a lot of evidence that they're being adopted at an accelerating pace by different communities. Is there any scholarship or writing about this trend that people could share?
