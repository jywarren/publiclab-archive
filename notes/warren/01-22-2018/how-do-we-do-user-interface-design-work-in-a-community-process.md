# How do we do user interface design work in a community process?

With generous support from Autodesk, @caufenkamp, @tommystyles, @julvie and I have been meeting for a few months, digging into tough questions about user interface design on PublicLab.org -- see this post, for some of the topics we got into: https://publiclab.org/questions/tommystyles/10-20-2017/need-your-feedback-on-tag-pages#a725

We have a lot to work from here, and you'll see a number of changes to our site leading out of this work and @siyuan's work [in this post](https://publiclab.org/notes/siyuan/06-12-2017/a-questions-page-to-encourage-discussions-through-better-ux)

Today we had a great discussion about how Public Lab might structure and support user interface design work going forward -- thinking about how designers who want to pitch in can quickly:

* get up to speed on design conventions and our "style"
* look through and choose design problems that need help
* learn about contextual details necessary to good design work
* find empirical data to work from -- interviews, user studies, survey results -- to inform design work
* get feedback on designs or test them out
* evaluate success of their design work

...all working in a small, modular workflow, rather than taking on massive bespoke design projects! [Read more about that here](/n/15543).

I'll paste the notes I took from this discussion below. Thanks to the whole Autodesk Pro Bono team!
