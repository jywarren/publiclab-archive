# Where can microscope lenses (objectives) be bought?

The #microscopes project is moving along amazingly. I see that the raspberry pi microscope project uses a cheap lens (or objective) -- where can these be bought and for how much?

Do they need to be a certain type to fit the design posted by @partsandcrafts?
