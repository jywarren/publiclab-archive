# What are different commercially available hydrogen sulfide detection methods?

We're compiling information about the:

* pros & cons
* prices
* sensitivity/limitations

about each of these techniques. 

See the https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-detection as well for more resources -- I've seen a few documented across the site!
