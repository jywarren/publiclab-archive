# In the plant based air purifier, could airflow go the other way, using an unmodified pump?

###What I want to do or know

I'd like to try to build the [plant based air purifier](https://publiclab.org/notes/nshapiro/09-26-2016/build-a-plant-based-air-purifier) and I have a pump, but I'm wondering if we could push air through instead of pulling, so a pump could just be used as-is?

Sorry if this is already answered, just curious!
