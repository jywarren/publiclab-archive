# Calculating volume from ground level photos?

@glennwalquist (who shared the above picture) has been [monitoring a sand mine site using a timelapse camera](https://publiclab.org/notes/glennwalquist/12-04-2016/monitoring-sargent-sand-mining-operation-in-ludington-michigan#comments), but says:

> I think that any data that approximates the quantity of sand ( in tonnage or some other practical measure ) that is being removed above and beneath the surface of the mining site is really what groups like ourselves (and FracTracker Alliance) are striving to somehow obtain. 

I'm curious if volume of sand could be measured using a 3d app like this:

Perhaps using some of the techniques posted by @cfastie and @patcoyle:

But I don't know how much (if anything) you can do from ground level.
