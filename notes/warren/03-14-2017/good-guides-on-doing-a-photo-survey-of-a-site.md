# Good guides on doing a photo survey of a site?

I've heard from both community groups and environmental lawyers that doing a basic photographic survey of a place is a really good first step in documenting almost any environmental problem. There are some great comments on this [in the June 2016 OpenHour on "Proof"](https://publiclab.org/wiki/openhour-archive#June+6th:+Exploring+Proof), for example.

I'm hoping we can include this as [part of our Methods page](/methods), and am looking for a good existing guide we can point people at. Does anyone know of some, hopefully illustrated or with photos (and example photos) for the kinds of photos and other information that make up a good basic description of an environmental problem's effect on a site?
