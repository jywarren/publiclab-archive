# Does the Beer Lambert law apply to the opacity of reagents?

I guess it depends on if the reagent color change is linearly related to the concentration of the target compound (say, nitrate).

Beer's Law determines the relationship between opacity and concentration. According to Beer's Law, if you double the concentration of a liquid, you should see double the opacity -- that is, it'll be twice as dark when you shine light through it. Here's some work people have shared to demonstrate this:
