# Seeking sources of local wind/weather data

In Leaflet Environmental Layers (LEL), our new-ish library to display many different sources of local environmental data in a single map (read more at #leaflet-environmental-layers), we're showing a growing range of data, including government databases, community-collected air data, FracTracker reports, and much more. 

  
But the weather (and specifically wind direction) data is not always very helpful -- 

  
See for example [this map of Houston](https://mapknitter.org/#9/29.5795/-94.8232), on MapKnitter, which uses LEL (enable the Purple Air layer in the upper right corner menu):

The wind data is from https://openweathermap.org, but it just doesn't show very many weather stations. It's even worse in rural areas:

What are some sources of higher resolution wind data? 

  
Note that some sites like OpenWeatherMap invite people to connect their weather stations, so the situation could improve as people join: https://openweathermap.org/stations

  
Thanks!
