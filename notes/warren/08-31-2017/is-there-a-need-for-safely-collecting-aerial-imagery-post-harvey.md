# Is there a need for safely collecting aerial imagery post-Harvey?

On the Open Call this past Tuesday, and on a call today, the topic of #aerial-photography came up, and while I want to encourage people not to take risks or to set aside urgent issues as Hurricane/Tropical Storm Harvey progresses, I wanted to pass on this question to see if there are any local requests for this, including for example #balloon-mapping or #kite-mapping resources or support.
