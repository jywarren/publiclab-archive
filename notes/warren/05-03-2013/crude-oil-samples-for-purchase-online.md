# Crude oil samples for purchase online

While we definitely want to be testing crude samples from known oil spills, having reference samples is also important to testing for petroleum contamination. This company (http://onta.com/) sells small vials of different types of crude oil which you can buy online. I haven't ordered any yet but would love to [compare laser or UV fluorescence](/notes/warren/10-1-2012/ultraviolet-fluorescence-bp-oil-residue-and-olive-oil) with this vs. one of our samples.

The "basic oil" set is only $5, or ~$10 shipped!
