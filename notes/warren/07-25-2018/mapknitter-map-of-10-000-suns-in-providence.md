# MapKnitter map of 10,000 Suns in Providence

Last Friday a few of us in Providence gathered to fly kites and take kite photos, at the [10,000 Suns](http://www.adameanderson.com/10000-suns/) site where the highway used to be. I uploaded a few of the good photos to MapKnitter - pitch in and let's make a map!
