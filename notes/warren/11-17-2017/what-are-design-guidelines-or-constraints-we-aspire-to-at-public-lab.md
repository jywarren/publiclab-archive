# What are design guidelines or constraints we aspire to at Public Lab?

It's easy to be at cross-purposes when collaborating if you don't have the same assumptions about the limits you're designing within. At Public Lab, we encourage accessibility and equity in projects. But how does this more specifically guide our design work?

  
We often work to ensure:

  
- low cost
- low complexity
- newcomer-friendly
- easily reproducible (Do-It-Yourself, [open source](/licenses))
- easily modifiable

But what else? And what are strategies to better embody these values when we build things?
