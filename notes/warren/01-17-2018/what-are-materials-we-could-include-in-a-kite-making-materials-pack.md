# What are materials we could include in a Kite Making Materials Pack?

The Public Lab Kits initiative is considering different materials packs to help people prototype and make kites and aerial photography rigs -- like in relation to:

- [Kite making](https://publiclab.org/kite-making)
- [Photo rigs](https://publiclab.org/photo-rig) for carrying cameras

We're thinking: Tyvek, spruce sticks, maybe fiberglass or carbon fiber rods, coroplast?

In particular Tyvek could be bought in a large roll and sold in smaller pieces at a more reasonable price.

Our partners at NASA's [AREN Project](/aren) are really interested in this kind of thing -- what would be good to include in this kind of pack?
