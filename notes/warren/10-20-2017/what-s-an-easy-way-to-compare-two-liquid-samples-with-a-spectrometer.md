# What's an easy way to compare two liquid samples with a spectrometer?

I'm interested in sharing out an activity on comparing two samples -- a "control" of distilled water and a sample of, say, river water -- to determine the opacity or #turbidity of the sample. I'm guessing the difference in color will be pretty minor, and may not be very easy to measure, so what's the best way to do this with:

- a [foldable spectrometer](/wiki/foldable-spec)
- a more rigid spectrometer like the [Desktop Spectrometry Kit](/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0)
