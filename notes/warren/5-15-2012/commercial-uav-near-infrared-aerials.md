# Commercial UAV near-infrared aerials

Good to see what commercial companies are doing with NIR:

> Take normal color, infrared and near infrared aerial images with geo-referencing hassle free. Merge the images together to generate a larger geo-referenced map. Predefined flight patterns enable the flight system to take images of large areas autonomously.
> Use NIR images to map areas of flora to extract NDVI, SAVI, canopy segmentation and NIR/Green ratios.
> IR cameras can be used for observing animals in hidden foliage.
> Normal color images can be used for high-resolution up-to-date maps instead of costly satellite images.
