# Request for kite/balloon mapping help at Tidmarsh Farms wetlands restoration in Plymouth MA

A LOT of events are coming up across the Public Lab network, folks -- this one on Saturday, October 21 from 3 pm to 7 pm near Plymouth, MA.

(lead image by @kanarinka)

Glorianna has been very interested in finding folks who can help do kite and balloon mappings of the amazing Living Observatory wetlands restoration project. We've worked at #tidmarsh a good bit over the years, but have never been able to do a really comprehensive map, nor on a regular schedule.

I'll be going myself and would love to work with anyone in the area to make a great map of the site.

Please check it out and RSVP using the below links -- families welcome!

Also - please write back too, so I know how many potential kite mappers may come :-)
