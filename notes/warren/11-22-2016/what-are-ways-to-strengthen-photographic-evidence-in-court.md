# What are ways to strengthen photographic evidence in court?

###What I want to do or know

Folks in the Public Lab network are increasingly interested in using photographs of pollution as evidence in legal cases, as a cheap and easy way to record incidents; see #photo-monitoring.

But what can you do to collect the best photographic evidence? Is there important metadata you can get by using a smartphone camera? Contextual information you can add? 

This is a followup question from today's [blog post on photographic evidence in court](https://publiclab.org/n/13716).
