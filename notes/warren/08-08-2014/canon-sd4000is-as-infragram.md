# Canon SD4000IS as Infragram

###What I want to do

We'd [struggled a year ago](/notes/warren/08-26-2013/results-from-aug-25-2013-tidmarsh-farms-mapping) to get a CMOS-sensor based Canon SD4000IS working as an [Infragram modified camera](/wiki/infragram), so when @nedhorning, @mathew and @cfastie posted about the [red filter Infragram technique](/wiki/infragram#Filters), I was eager to see if that could get this excellent camera working. You can read more about Mathew and Chris's research here: http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/04-30-2014/rosco-replacements-for-wratten-25a-pt-2

###My attempt and results

My SD4000IS already had its infrared block filter removed, so I just taped a piece of Rosco Fire filter over the front. It seems to have worked very well! Much better differentiation than with a blue filter:

###Questions and next steps

It'd be more ideal to test these in a grassy field, but these are encouraging!
