# Testing wines with UV-visible spectrometry

A couple of good papers on this are attached.

**Rapid determination of phenolic components in red wines from UV-Visible spectra and the method of partial least squares**

By: K. Skogerson, M. Downey, M. Mazza, and R. Boulton 

* identified anthocyanins, polymeric pigments, small polymeric pigments, tannins, non-tannin phenols, and total phenols

**Wine Color Analysis using the Evolution Array UV-Visible Spectrophotometer**

By: Gordon Bain, Ph.D., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madison, WI, USA 

* This one just has some good wine spectra, both red and white wines (pictured above)
