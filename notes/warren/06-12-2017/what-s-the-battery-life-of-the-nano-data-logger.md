# What's the battery life of the Nano Data Logger?

Hi, I know @cfastie has [posted](https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/06-12-2017/what-are-the-differences-between-the-nano-data-logger-and-the-riffle#a253) that it's not a long battery life due to USB, the lack of alarms on the real-time clock, and other things, but how long is it? 

I think this is probably just answered in one of the #nano-data-logger notes, but thought it'll be a common question.

I'm also curious how much difference it makes to use a much larger battery, or more batteries. Can you run it for a week or two?
