# Can we use a guitar tuning app to get numeric data from the Coqui water sensor? 

The Coqui is great, and people have a great time building it. But many ask how we can measure quantitative values from it.  [This post has some ideas](https://publiclab.org/notes/imvec/06-11-2018/analizing-the-signal-of-the-coqui-using-audacity) for analyzing the sound, but i was thinking more about this and have been trying to use a guitar tuning app... only semi-successfully!

  
[http://guitar-tuner.appspot.com](http://guitar-tuner.appspot.com/) doesn't seem to work... i tried some apps too. The ideal would be to get a concrete measurement of frequency, but i wonder if the Coqui is often outside the range many apps would listen...? Or it's pretty quiet... I'd love it folks tried this out and reported back in!
