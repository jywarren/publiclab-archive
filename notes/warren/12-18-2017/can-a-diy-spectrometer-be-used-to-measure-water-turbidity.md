# Can a DIY spectrometer be used to measure water turbidity?

I've seen some good work on #beers-law, which deals with concentration in a liquid sample. Since lots of people are interested in using spectrometers to do this; what kind of experiment design would enable quantitative measurements of turbidity with a DIY spectrometer like one of these?
