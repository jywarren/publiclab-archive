# Where are people compiling lists of potential pollution sites following Hurricane Harvey?

There's been some requests to reduce redundancy and to unify the different tracking systems that are emerging for industrial complexes and potential pollution sites following Hurricane Harvey.

Do you know of datasets or lists being compiled that could be merged or cross-referenced somehow? 

Also - if people are interested in helping combine these various data sources, please speak up! Thank you!
