# How do I identify an oil sheen or spill or slick in aerial photography?

Via @Zengirl2 -- I know there are guides out there; i think we can dig one up and some example images as well. Please help out - re: #harvey-response !

Also note we're collecting sources for imagery here: https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/09-12-2017/what-are-some-sources-of-new-aerial-imagery-of-harvey-damages

Thanks!
