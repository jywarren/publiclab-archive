# What are some activities for using the Simple Air Sensor as part of a broader air quality project?

While the Simple Air Sensor doesn't log or record, doesn't display numeric data, and doesn't convert pm2.5 or pm10 values into an Air Quality Index to quantify health risks, it does display data immediately with a colored light. This could make it a good tool for a few different uses, and I wanted to brainstorm with folks. I'll put a few ideas in the comments, but would love to hear more!  

Here's where to buy the #simple-air-sensor for $50 [in the Public Lab Store](https://store.publiclab.org/products/simple-air-sensor "https://store.publiclab.org/products/simple-air-sensor").
