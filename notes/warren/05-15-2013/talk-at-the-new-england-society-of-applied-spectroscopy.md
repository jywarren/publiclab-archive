# Talk at the New England Society of Applied Spectroscopy

I'm giving a short talk at the NE chapter of the Society of Applied Spectroscopy today outside Boston, and wanted to share my presentation here as well -- it includes some nice introductory shots of the Infragram camera too. Feel free to reuse parts or all!
