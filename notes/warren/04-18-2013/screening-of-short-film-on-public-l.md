# Screening of short film on Public Lab on April 19

(via [Caterina Scaramelli](http://web.mit.edu/hasts/graduate/scaramelli.html)) 

> A short rough cut of the documentary I am making will be screened at the MIT Museum on Friday 19th, 6-8 as part of the program "Making movies, making science". The screening will include works by students of the DV Lab: Documenting Science classes at MIT, taught by Christine Walley and Chris Boebel. It features participants from the Cocodrie Barnraising 2012, kites, and things.
