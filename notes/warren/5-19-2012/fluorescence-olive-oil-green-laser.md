# Fluorescence in olive oil with green laser

For spectrometry of oil, I'm starting to think about using a laser, which has a very narrow and specific color, to get samples to fluoresce. Then, using a [spectrometer](/tool/spectrometer), we could measure the color of the fluorescing light, without interference from the source light.

The above test shows how even a lighter oil like olive oil fluoresces reddish when hit with a green laser. Cool. Now i have to build a new spectrometer -- I shipped all of mine out to kit buyers...
