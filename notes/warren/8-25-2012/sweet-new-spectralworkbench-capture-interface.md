# Sweet new SpectralWorkbench capture interface

Two-column, darker to make low light usage easier... lots of improvements. See at <a href="https://spectralworkbench.org/capture?alt=true" rel="nofollow">spectralworkbench.org/capture?alt=true</a>

If this works well i'll push it to the default pretty soon. Exciting!
