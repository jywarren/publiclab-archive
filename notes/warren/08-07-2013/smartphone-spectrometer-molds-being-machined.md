# Smartphone spectrometer molds being machined

Louis from [ProtoEdge](http://protoedge.com) just sent me these great photos of the aluminum molds being machined for the upcoming smartphone spectrometers, and assures us that production is going as planned. Eager to get these out to backers of our [DIY Spectrometry Kit Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit/)
