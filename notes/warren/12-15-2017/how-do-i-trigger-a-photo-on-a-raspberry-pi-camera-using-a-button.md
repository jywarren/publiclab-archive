# How do I trigger a photo on a Raspberry Pi camera using a button?

Using the #raspberry-pi as a camera (#pi-camera) is cheap, lightweight, and easy to connect to projects like #infragram, the #lego-spectrometer, #timelapse, and others. But is there an easy way to connect a button and just use it as a point and shoot camera? I think there must be, using the "GPIO pins" -- any quick and easy guides to do this?

We could integrate this into the preflashed firmware being developed for the #basic-microscope project!
