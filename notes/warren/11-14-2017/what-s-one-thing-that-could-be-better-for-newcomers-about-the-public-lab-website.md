# What's one thing that could be better for newcomers about the Public Lab website?

I often hear from people about something they wish were better on PublicLab.org, and we love hearing about both ideas for better design choices and even about problems folks have had -- it's the first step in solving these problems and making progress on them. 

Especially if you're a newcomer to Public Lab, **tell us one specific thing you'd like to see improved on the site**, whether it's a cleaner design on a page, a new way to organize the dashboard, or anything else. 

One of the challenges we face is that everyone has a different opinion of how the site should work, because of course everyone uses it differently. So don't be surprised or discouraged if you see people suggesting something different than you. We should work to make the site useful for everybody, and need to hear different voices to do that!

Thanks for helping to improve the website!
