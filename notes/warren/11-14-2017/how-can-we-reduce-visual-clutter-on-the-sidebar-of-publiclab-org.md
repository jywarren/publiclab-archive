# How can we reduce visual clutter on the sidebar of PublicLab.org?

There's an ongoing project to reimagine the purpose, and then the design, of the sidebar on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org). More details are here:

[https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1706](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1706)

...but this refers to the kind of content that appears in the left sidebar of pages like this:

  
- https://publiclab.org/wiki/microscopes or
- https://publiclab.org/notes/partsandcrafts/10-26-2017/making-a-hackteria-microscope  

  
  
What do people think about this?

I can think of a few starting points:

1\. we could look at some of what Siyuan suggested re: moving sidebar to the right side (see the last comment): [https://publiclab.org/notes/siyuan/06-12-2017/a-questions-page-to-encourage-discussions-through-better-ux](https://publiclab.org/notes/siyuan/06-12-2017/a-questions-page-to-encourage-discussions-through-better-ux)

2\. we could think through where displaying related content would be more helpful (at the end of the page? See references from, for example, [nytimes.com](http://nytimes.com) articles)

3\. we could look into Google Analytics to see if we can learn about how often people do cross-navigate into related content

4\. we could think through how related content is auto-identified, and try to do a better job, to make it /more/ relevant
