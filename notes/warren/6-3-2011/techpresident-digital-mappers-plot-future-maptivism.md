# TechPresident: Digital Mappers Plot the Future of Maptivism

<div>Egads! I was quoted as saying &quot;does it always have to be open source? No...&quot; -- but don&#39;t worry, I had a good reason to say so:</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/digital-mappers-plot-future-maptivism-0">http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/digital-mappers-plot-future-maptivism-0</a> (by Nancy Scola)</div>
<br><div>&gt;Â <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, &#39;Times New Roman&#39;, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 25px; ">And Warren, at least, worries about the presumption that new mapping technologies are inextricably tied to the open data movement. &quot;Does it always have to be open source?,&quot; he says, before answering his own question. &quot;No, some data doesn&#39;t have to be.&quot; Communities with unsettled land claims might not be eager, for example, to have their fields and grazing patterns precisely plotted out. &quot;They want to keep it private, and that&#39;s legit.&quot; He points to mapping work he did in some of Lima&#39;s challenged neighborhoods. &quot;We haven&#39;t submitted it to OpenStreetMap. We haven&#39;t made it compatible with any other system. We haven&#39;t translated it into anything beyond being just a picture.&quot;</span></div>
