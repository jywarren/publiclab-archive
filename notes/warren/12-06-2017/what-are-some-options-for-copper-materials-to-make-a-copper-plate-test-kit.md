# What are some options for copper materials to make a copper plate test kit?

We've looked at copper pipes and plates as potential materials for our prototype copper plate discoloration test for hydrogen sulfide.

What are some other options? We're looking for:

- low cost
- easy to cut would be nice
- small, say 3x3 inches or less?
- can be scrubbed with acetone or solvent to clean off
- high purity copper? 

What have folks tried, or wanted to try out? We're hoping to make a [prototyping kit](/wiki/prototyping-kits) for this!

Also see this related question about setup:

And this one about how to scrub them clean before testing:
