# Temperature and humidity sensors to correct H2S sensor

The Figaro TGS 825 hydrogen sulfide sensor needs to be corrected for ambient temperature and humidiy, as Justin Marrese and I discovered at the sensor meetup on Saturday. I found a couple options which beat the $30 sparkfun temp/humidity sensor:

* [$15 combined temp/humidity sensor](http://parts.digikey.com/1/parts/946092-sensor-rh-ntc-cap-side-open-smd-hts2030smd.html)
* [$11.45 humidity sensor](http://parts.digikey.com/1/parts/1691861-humidity-sensor-smd-3-hih-5030-001.html) which could be combined with a thermistor, i guess.
