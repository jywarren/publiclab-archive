# IRCam compact wiring prototype

Just a quick update about the in-development IRCam -- trying to make the case more compact by using lots of right-angle USB cables, and also a Y-splitter so we can continue to use the WiFi dongle along with the 2 webcams. Not sure this all powers up, but that's the next test. I also have more cable adapters to try different combinations and setups.
