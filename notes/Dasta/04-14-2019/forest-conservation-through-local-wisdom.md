# Forest Conservation Through Local Wisdom

Actually, forest conservation efforts have been made by indigenous peoples from generation to generation with local wisdom.

  
Community condition that is very dependent on nature raises a set of knowledge about the ecosystem and its components, such as animals, plants and fungi.  

  
In the application of this knowledge, they also develop [nature conservation ](https://sainsterkini.com/perlindungan-kerusakan-hutan/ "https://sainsterkini.com/perlindungan-kerusakan-hutan/")[methods](https://sainsterkini.com/perlindungan-kerusakan-hutan/), including the prohibitions to preserve the nature. Punishment are made for the implementation of the rules they set.

  
The pattern of forest management and preservation carried out by customary law communities generally comes from original knowledge that exists and grows in the community complete with all the values, norms and sanctions.  

  
This management pattern develops very dynamically. Although this is not explicitly stated as nature resource management.

  
Therefore, it is necessary to have sufficient understanding by the local government regarding these management patterns to be developed.

  
Many forest management and conservation practices are mostly carried out by indigenous peoples in Indonesia in various terms.

  
For example, _mamar_ in East Nusa Tenggara, _lembo_ for Dayak people in East Kalimantan, _tembawang_ for Dayak people in West Kalimantan, _repong_ for Peminggir Community in Lampung, and _tombak_for Batak people in North Tapanuli.

  
Here is one example of the local wisdom of the Suku Anak Dalam community in Jambi, namely Kayu Ditajom Diseliligi.

This tree should not be disturbed, either cut down or simply cut down on the stem.

  
The practice shows that indigenous peoples have and are able to manage natural resources including their forests for generations.

  
These patterns are known to have very diverse and dynamic forms of application that produce various benefits for society and the environment.

  
The rationality of values in traditional societies that still consider myths and metaphysics in shaping environmental preservation values is reasonable.

  
An example is the prohibited area, sacred plants and animals. These prohibited areas, sacred plants and animals are usually risky for [exploitation](https://sainsterkini.com/masalah-pelestarian-lingkungan-hidup/). Fragility can be caused by a limited amount. People believe that the bad consequences will be received if they exploit this area, plants or animals.
