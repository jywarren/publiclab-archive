# Is it possible to have a digital copy of the step-by-step instructions?

---------

Hi! Sorry for the delay in answering the question. We used the designs from Glenn Davison's book ([available for $9.99](https://www.amazon.com/Miniature-Kites-build-kites-actually/dp/1507726279)). He is a huge supporter! We built the Korean Fighter Kite and Rokkaku kites on pp. 43 and 44\. He also has many more kite websites, all listed at [http://www.kitingusa.com/](http://www.kitingusa.com/) including one on Kites in the Classroom that I'm definitely going to check out. Have fun!![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/024/603/large/51V3EhVwgfL._SX385_BO1_204_203_200_.jpg "51V3EhVwgfL._SX385_BO1_204_203_200_.jpg")
