# Globe Icon for Translation Team Members

The members of the Translation Team might see a globe-icon besides a text or button that needs to be translated. It acts like a tooltip for translators to highlight that the language has some missing translations.

Translators can click on the globe icon and they will be redirected to the string translation page on the Public Lab Transifex Project. Other strings missing translation can also be found on the left-hand side of the page.Once all the strings are translated, you won't see the icon.
