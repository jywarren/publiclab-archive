# how can i get a more precise wavelenght-scale to  this spectrum --distances 5nm or less ?

a more precise nanometer scale would make possible a more exact identificationn an d termination of some materials. i would think of a scale with five or better only one nm - distances. can i use such a scale on the current programme already or ist it  matter of improvement  and development?
