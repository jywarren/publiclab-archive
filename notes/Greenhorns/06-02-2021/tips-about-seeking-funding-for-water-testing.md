# Tips about seeking funding for water testing?

Looking to set up a community water testing program here in Downeast Maine, but boy-oh-boy is it expensive (~$100 a test). We've got lots of contacts for local grants and organizations who are interested in helping, but we are reaching out here to see if any one in this big, beautiful community might have tips about where else to look for funding opportunities for this kind of project.

  
thanks!
