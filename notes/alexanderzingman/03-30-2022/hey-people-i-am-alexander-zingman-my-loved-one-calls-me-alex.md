# Hey people, I am Alexander Zingman, my loved one calls me Alex. 

My Name Is [Alexander Zingman](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alexander-zingman-025508222/es?trk=people-guest_people_search-card). I am in the middle age of my life i.e., 52 as of now. I am a born- greenie because of the climate I was born and brought up that is Belarus, a beautiful country with kind-hearted people. I love exploring new places and vlogging/blogging about that to make my viewers see and satisfy their soul through it. Apart from all of these, I am also very fond of music, it led me to another level of motivation to kept going & doing my research about new places and make myself fit for the travelling across the country.
