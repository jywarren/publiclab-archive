# Low-cost air quality sensors to measure PM2.5, PM10?

I currently live near a busy intersection and I wanted to some for of measurement of PM2.5, PM10 as from what I've read, car pollution are the main culprits of these particles. I then wanted to try to reduce then via air purifiers and see if it makes a difference.   

  
I'm seeing a lot of inexpensive detectors on AliExpress, but I'm a little overwhlemd with the choices.

  
I also saw these on amazon:

https://www.amazon.com/product-Thermometer-Humidity-sensitive-Detector/dp/B079N33W91/ref=sr\_1\_20?ie=UTF8&qid=1534615644&sr=8-20&keywords=SNDWAY  

  
https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Detector-Temperature-Humidity-Function/dp/B077QS61K7

  
However, they seem to be using the same sensors, so not sure what the reason for the price difference is.   

  
Any recommendations?

  
Thank you.
