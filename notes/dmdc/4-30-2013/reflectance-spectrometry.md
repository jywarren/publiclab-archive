# Reflectance spectrometry

I am working on developing a database for conservation technicians to use in identifying materials, but I am having problems using reflectance. I seem to get the same shaped graph for all the materials for which I record spectra. Does anyone have success with reflectance, and if so, what sort of light source do you use, and how do you set up light, sample and spectrometer?
