# Cleaning Storm Drains

### Introduction:

In New Orleans we have floods, one of the biggest concerns about floods can be littering, why? Well, because it literally causes stock up drains which gives water no place to go. Another cause of drain stocked up because of leaves and trash. This can be a problem because this can damage houses, cars, it can carry things from place to place so the biggest picture is, how can this be fixed.

  
### Our main concern:

Our main concern is cleaning the storm drain pipes.

  
Obstacles and supporting information:  

We need to know whether or not the drains are blocking water from going into them because if it is, the drains need to be re-made bigger so that the city can have less floods.

### Who is engaged in this concern?

People of the city because, people pay lots of money for vehicles and with the amount of litter feeling the streets, which can block drains, water will fill the streets causing floods which can damage cars, streets, houses and so much more. Wildlife center workers can also have an issue with this because if the plastic continues to flood the streets it can be consumed by animals which can kill them which is also very bad.
