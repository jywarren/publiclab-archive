# Spectra Workbench for offline use?

Dear spectral workbench developers,

could you give me an advise on which sw package to download for using spectral workbench offline? For our field deployments in the Chilean desert we *require* an application the does not require an internet connection.

I guess this application could be deployed on a locally running webserver, and I'd appreciate your support by describing the packages that need to be installed (e.g. apache, php, python, ...) which then should allow us to install it on one or more of our Lubuntu-based netbooks. 

Best regards and thank in advance - David
