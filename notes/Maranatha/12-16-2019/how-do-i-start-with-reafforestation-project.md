# How do I start with reafforestation project?

In the part of my neighbourhood where I am currently studying (124507 Housing Board, Sector 3A Sarai Aurangabad, Bahadurgarh, Haryana India), investigations indicate there is a gradual vegetation loss due to infrastructural projects. There has been an adverse  consequence on the health and climate of the area.

  
In view of the negative implications this would have over the long run, I discussed with other concerned neighbours, some friends and classmates and we want to embark on a tree-planting project during the winter season. However, we do not have much expertise and knowledge in this matter, therefore the need to solicit for advise on how we can go about it successfully.

  
I do believe with all my heart that a little input from you would go really equip us, at least a motivating factor for us to start the project. Humbly awaiting your response. 

  
Thank you!
