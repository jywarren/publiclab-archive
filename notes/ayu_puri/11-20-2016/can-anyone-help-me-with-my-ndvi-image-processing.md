# can anyone help me with my ndvi ( image processing ) ?

I do some research about NDVI (image processing) use camera mobius with red filter. 
for image processing, i'm using visual studio c#. i'm confused with my image proccesing, image in c# have 3 layers.

I'm using formula 
ndvi= Nir-Vis/Nir+Vis

Vis= Blue channel
Nir= red channel

after i'm process that formula, i'm confused to put the result in which layer ?
And what will i do with the other layer ?  what i must be filled in that layer,  is that data from our image before process the formula or i must fill it with the other value ?

please someone help me
