# Which is more accurate in measuring formaldehyde: air sampling tubes vs RKI FP-30?

I need to figure out the level of formaldehyde in my house.    I know I can use different methods and each has its pros and cons.  Right now I need to know whether the air sampling tubes is more or less accurate than RKI FP-30\.
