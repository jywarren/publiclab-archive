# What is the hydrogen sulfide concentration range that can be monitored using a copper tarnish method?

I'm interested in working on the copper pipe method developed by Lionel Milberger, described here: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-copper-pipe](https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-copper-pipe). There are some core questions we need to answer, the first of which relates to the detection range possible using a visual copper tarnish method.
