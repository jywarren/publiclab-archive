# Do you have resources on odor logs and odor reporting platforms? 

I'm interested in how people document and report odors, both to compile community information and to notify local authorities of a problem that needs to be addressed. 

What resources have you seen? Does your county have a reporting form or online platform? Have you used on online platform like [SmellPGH](smellpgh.org) or the [FracTracker app](https://www.fractracker.org/apps/)? I'd love to compile a list and people's thoughts about their utility for different purposes!
