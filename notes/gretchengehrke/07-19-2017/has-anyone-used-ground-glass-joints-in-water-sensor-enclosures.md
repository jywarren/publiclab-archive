# Has anyone used ground glass joints in water sensor enclosures?

I’m interested in low-cost water sensor enclosures to make a probe into a deployable unit. From this page [https://publiclab.org/wiki/sensor-enclosures](https://publiclab.org/wiki/sensor-enclosures), it looks like there have been various iterations of plastic water bottle enclosures. I’m curious if anyone has tried glass enclosures with ground glass joints? It wouldn’t work at depth due to pressure, but in shallow water, would a ground glass joint be more water-tight? Are there low-cost glass options?
