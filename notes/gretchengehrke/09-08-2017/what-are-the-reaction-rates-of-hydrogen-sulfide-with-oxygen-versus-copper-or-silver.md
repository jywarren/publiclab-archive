# What are the reaction rates of hydrogen sulfide with oxygen versus copper or silver? 

We're planning experiments to compare various DIY methods for monitoring airborne hydrogen sulfide, including at least the silver photo paper method (described here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-sensor) and the copper rod method (described here: https://publiclab.org/notes/sharon-wilson/3-21-2012/copper-rod-test-h2s). I've been searching online, but am not having much luck finding information about the rates or mechanisms of the reactions of interest. Does anyone know of informational resources to find: 

  
1\. oxidation rates of hydrogen sulfide by oxygen versus reaction rates with elemental copper or monovalent silver?

2\. photo-reduction rates of silver chloride versus reaction rates of silver chloride with sulfide?

3\. oxidation rates of copper with oxygen versus sulfide?

  
Thanks!!
