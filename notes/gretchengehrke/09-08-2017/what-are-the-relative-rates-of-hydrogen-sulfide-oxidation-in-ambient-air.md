# What are the relative rates of hydrogen sulfide oxidation in ambient air?

I'm interested in understanding likely variation in hydrogen sulfide concentration near oil and gas wells due to oxidation in the atmosphere, and I'm having difficulty finding information about hydrogen sulfide oxidation under various conditions. Does anyone have a good resource or happen to know what rates would be under high UV, low UV, with acidic rain or humidity, with high particulate matter, etc?
