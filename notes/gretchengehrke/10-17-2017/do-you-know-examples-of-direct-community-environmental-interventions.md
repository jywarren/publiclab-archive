# Do you know examples of direct community environmental interventions?

Hi folks! I am looking for examples of when communities have taken action to remediate an environmental contamination or mitigate exposure to it, without requesting funding or intervention by governmental agencies. Most of the examples of neighborhood hazard mitigation that I've seen have been funded by the EPA or state environmental agencies, and I am hoping to learn from situations where communities have self-organized, funded, and implemented remediation or mitigation strategies. Please answer below if you know of any!
