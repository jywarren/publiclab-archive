# What is your favorite program to plot data from a data logger? 

In order to make sense of data from sensors that collect more data than can be easily interpreted in table format, I want to export data from my data logger to a free plotting software. What is your favorite program that is user-friendly and has more functionality than Google Sheets? Thanks!
