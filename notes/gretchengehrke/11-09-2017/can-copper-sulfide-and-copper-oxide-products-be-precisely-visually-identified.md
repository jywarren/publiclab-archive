# Can copper sulfide and copper oxide products be precisely visually identified?

I'm interested in using the copper pipe method for detecting hydrogen sulfide that Lionel Milberger has been developing (here: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-copper-pipe](https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-copper-pipe)). Copper is subject to oxidation and sulfidation, and a lot of folks are curious how well we can distinguish cuprous oxide (Cu2O, which has a reddish color), cupric oxide (CuO, which has a black/brown color), and cupric sulfide (CuS, which has a black color). Can we distinguish them visually? What are other methods for distinguishing them?
