# How do you find industrial WPDES permit details? 

I've been looking for specific wastewater discharge permit information for a facility in Wisconsin. I can find that the facility has an individual WPDES (Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) permit, rather than falling under an industry-wide general permit, from the spreadsheet available here: http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/wastewater/PermitLists.html. However, after a thorough attempt navigating the DNR website and a few Internet searches using the permit number and a variety of keywords (e.g. WPDES permit, wastewater permit, Wisconsin DNR, etc), I haven't found a page that lists the exact permit information.  It's much more straightforward to find air permit and stormwater permit detailed information. Does anyone know how to find wastewater individual permit details for Wisconsin companies?
