# Vehicular emission sense and control using sensors and actuators

###What I want to do: sense and capture harmful gas at source: Vehiclular tail pipe. 

###My attempt and results: I've identified few sensors but waiting for pilot to be done. 

###Questions and next steps: I need innovative designers to do the pilot in a vehicle.

###Why I'm interested: Since this problem is potential...as youngsters we can take up this together and find a solution.
