# Why are the PM10 particles of the Purpleair monitor biased so high?

I work for a research
team for the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire, and we are attempting to
discern the validity of the data that is generated from the purple air
monitors. Listed following this is a link to the AQI field test of the purple
air monitor. This field test showed the PM10 to be biased rather high.
