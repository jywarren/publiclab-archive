# Does particle composition that the purple air monitors measure greatly skew the data output? 

The
optical characteristics of aerosols such as organic carbon and silica would
likely reflect differently considering the purple air monitor uses laser
spectroscopy. I work for a research
team for the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire, and we are attempting to
discern the validity of the data that is generated from the purple air
monitors. Listed following this is a link to the AQI field test of the purple
air monitor. [http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/aq-spec/field-evaluations/purple-air-pa-ii---field-evaluation.pdf?sfvrsn=2](http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/aq-spec/field-evaluations/purple-air-pa-ii---field-evaluation.pdf?sfvrsn=2)
