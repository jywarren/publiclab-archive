#  Helium Cylinder (15 Litre) Mobius Action Camera Balloon mapping Kit How long will my cylinder last?

Whats the capacity/volume of the balloon and how long can i use it to monitor the farm if i use it once a week? I need the tentative time where i need to refill the cylinder as i want to provide these services to remote farm area?

  
I look forward  to hear from you amazing people.  
  

Thank you
