# spectralworkbench fails to recognize camera

Running ubuntu 16.04 can see the output of the spectrometer on VLC so it appears to be working in a fashion at least.  I have given spectral workbench permission to use the webcam (the only one on the system) and if I examine my preferences it appears to be the case.  However all I get is a black screen.  Even downloading it and tryin gto run offline does not seem to help.  Any ideas as to what to try next would be most appreciated.
