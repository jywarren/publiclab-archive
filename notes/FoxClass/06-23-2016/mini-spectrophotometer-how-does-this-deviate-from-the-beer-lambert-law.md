# Mini spectrophotometer - how does this deviate from the Beer-Lambert law?

I'm looking at using the mini foldable spectrophotometer (from Public Lab) to monitor qualitative colour changes of a solution in a glass vessel over a short period of time.  I'm curious if the simple hardware and SpectralWorkbench could do this, since the colour change in the image should, I suppose, be able to detect a subtle change in the spectrum so long as the room lighting remains constant.

I'm also curious how the measurements taken on the mini spec would relate to concentration of analyte, since there's not really a 'path-length' involved.  Would it be a logarithmic relationship to concentration?

Thanks for your thoughts!
