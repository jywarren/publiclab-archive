# Carbon Arc

I have been working a small project to allow more energetic reactions than a Propane torch. The concept here is to utilize a Carbon Arc to to achieve this.
At present this would be a Lab base device, but could be amended for field work.
I am new here at posting information, so hopefully I'll get it correct this time around.
Regards
Bill
