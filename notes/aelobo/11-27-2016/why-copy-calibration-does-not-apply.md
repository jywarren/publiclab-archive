# Why copy calibration does not apply?

I have uploaded an image and calibrated it, then uploaded another image, and tried to use copy calibration on it. The calibrated image gets listed when searched for, by it's name, but after I apply it to the new image, nothing happens. 

Calibrated Image - https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/92343#notifications
New Image - https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/92347

Thanks!
