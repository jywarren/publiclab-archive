# CHDK : Jpeg VS Raw

I have done some comparison between the Jpeg format and the Raw format from my Canon A800 then I took a picture with my Nikon D5100. So, you can compare it with the others and see wich format is more closer with my Nikon D5100.In my opinion, the Raw is more vivid than the Jpeg.

So, you can use open source software to convert raw to something readable. Honestly, I prefer the RawTherapee.
