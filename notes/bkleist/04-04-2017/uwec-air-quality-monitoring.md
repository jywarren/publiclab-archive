# UWEC air quality monitoring

The UWEC Environmental Public Health research team has begun
operations in full swing for spring research. Monitoring industrial sand
facilities and measuring air quality will continue on as it has, but one
project is a bit different this year. The team will be monitoring air quality
on the UWEC campus during the reconstruction of Garfield Ave. The project aims
to ensure that particulate concentrations don't reach levels that can cause
adverse health effects, as well as to determine how much of a role large
machinery plays in air pollution. Garfield Ave is a road that leads through the
heart of campus, and is scheduled to be removed. The [project](http://www.uwec.edu/facprojects/garfield.htm) aims to make
the UWEC campus more pedestrian-friendly, as well as to bring a bit more nature
into the campus. 

Last Monday (March 26, 2017), members of Public Lab and two
active community members met to deploy air quality monitoring equipment on the
roof of a building on campus. After a brief meeting to meet each other and to
discuss plans, the group made our way to a rooftop that overlooks the
construction site.

**The map above illustrates the construction area (Red area), and the
monitoring equipment that the research team deployed (Green indicator). The blue
indicator represents a webcam that UWEC operates. **

The location of the equipment was carefully selected, so it
would get the full exposure from particulates thanks to the prevailing winds
(southerly) in Eau Claire. A Dylos air monitor (DC1100 I believe) connected to
a Raspberry Pi computer transmits data to an online server via an Ethernet
connection. The configuration is housed in a makeshift shelter consisting of a
small animal carrier with plastic taped to the top to protect against rain. 

A Mobius ActionCam and Crenova Trail camera are
also scheduled to be deployed near the construction area. The cameras will be
used to complement the view of the [webcam](http://www.uwec.edu/LTS/services/media/streaming/footbridge.htm)
that the University is operating on top of Schofield Hall. Monitoring from many
angles is advantageous because different vantage points
