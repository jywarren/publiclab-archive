# Air Quality Monitoring at UWEC

Air quality research is beginning again once again in Eau Claire, this time a bit closer to home. The university is planning a [construction project](http://www.uwec.edu/facprojects/garfield.htm) to remodel Garfield Ave, a street that cuts through the campus. Our research team is moving some of our equipment from Bloomer WI, to the UWEC campus to take measurements during construction. We have also received a new trail camera that Public Lab generously sent us to use, which our research professor has had in his possession. I will be picking up the camera later today and will be familiarizing myself with it this week. I will post another research note once the role of the camera in this research becomes more clear, probably in about a week or so. 

  
Our group met this morning to discuss possible locations to move the equipment on campus, and bounced around a few ideas of the best ways to gather contextual data as well. One of the ideas is to deploy a Dylos air monitor that is connected to the internet to get real time data, and to deploy a Go Pro camera with the Dylos. Newer models of Go Pro cameras can connect to the internet, so we would be able to know what is going on if airborne particulates spike. One of the ideas was to possibly set up notifications that team members would receive if particulates spiked, but we were unsure if it was possible to set the Dylos up to notify us.
