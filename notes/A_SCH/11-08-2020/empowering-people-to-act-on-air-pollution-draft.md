Bobby Peek explains how bucket monitors are powerful tools communities can use to organize around and create campaigns.

In creating a successful campaign two main things are needed: data and social advocacy. Buckets are the tool that provide the data necessary in proving the legitimacy of the community concern. They strengthen the campaign by being able to prove to industry, government, and fellow community members the very real and very serious risk caused by polluters. At the same time, data alone cannot create change, it needs the voices and energy of people behind it to make sure it is seen and taken seriously. This is where the **system** of the bucket brigade come into play by using the available **tools** of bucket monitors and social advocacy tactics to build a powerful campaign.

One of the most important aspects of bucket monitoring is that it's community controlled. Communities don't have to wait for, or fight for, data to be released, instead they can gather the information themselves. This allows communities to both work on their own timeline as well as have a better pathway to challenge the data and claims of industries.

> "It's **good science** that communities can use in their **daily organizing** and campaigning."

Bucket monitors are successful tools because they are accessible without sacrificing reliability. The technology is relatively inexpensive when compared to other air monitors and easy to build meaning it can be used often, and widely through a community. It's reliable because it consistently produces accurate information about the air quality and in-depth data about specific chemical levels. This combination makes bucket monitors an ideal air sampling method for community use and campaigning.
