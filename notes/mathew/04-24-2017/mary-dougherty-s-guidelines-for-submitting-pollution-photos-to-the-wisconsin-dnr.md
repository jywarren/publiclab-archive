# Mary Dougherty's guidelines for submitting pollution photos to the Wisconsin DNR

During the 2017 Wisconsin Conservation Lobby Day put on by the League of Conservation Voters, Mary Dougherty, a [photographer](http://www.wordsforwater.com/our-story/) from Bayfield County [active against CAFOs](http://midwestadvocates.org/news-events/news/cafo-qa-with-bayfield-county-resident-rallying-for-clean-water/) (Confined Animal Feed Operations, did a presentation on documenting CAFOs pollution. She presented a list of factors she has been asked to include in video and photos of runoff events from CAFOs.

According to Mary, a video or photo set should include:

1. Date and time in the video's time stamp, but also independent date verification in the video such as a phone or newspaper.
2. Location information in the video-- such as a cross street
3. Direction you're facing, and landmarks to prove it
4. Verification of the violator-- a street number, identification of the property, a license plate
5. Verification of your identity-- your voice and image in the video.
