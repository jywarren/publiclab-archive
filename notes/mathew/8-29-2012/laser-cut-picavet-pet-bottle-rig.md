# laser-cut picavet for PET bottle rig

I met Myles at [Toorcamp](http://toorcamp.org/). He got excited about kite mapping and made this [laser-cut picavet rigging for fitting onto the top of a bottle rig and posted it to thingaverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29308).  The most clever part is using bike chain links as the pulleys.
