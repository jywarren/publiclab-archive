# Tweeking Jeff's fold-up Spectrometer

Some small tweeks to [Jeff's fold-up paper spectrometer](/notes/warren/10-10-2012/first-draft-vector-files-foldable-mini-spectrometer)-- 

Side by side in the gallery.

Layout/mailer idea: print it on an 8.5x11, fold over with a piece of DVD taped on the inside, and mail as standard mail.
