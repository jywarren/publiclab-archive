# Flightstats.com for Passenger Pigeon

[Passenger Pigeon](/wiki/passenger-pigeon) is a concept for getting folks to photograph sites of interest out passenger airplane windows.  [Flightstats](http://www.flightstats.com/) is a site that allows one to track the positions of existing flights and future in order to help passengers plan their flights.  There might be a way to use Flightstats data to enable passengers to discover sites of interest they're going to fly over, and approximately when they will be overhead to start photographing.
