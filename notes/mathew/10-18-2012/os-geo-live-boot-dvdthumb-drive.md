# OS Geo Live Boot DVD/Thumb Drive

I believe several applications on here are server apps running on localhost.  Its potentially a framework for us to create a local, bootable system for running our web tools.  Found it via visiting [PDX Open Geo](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/PDX-OSGEO).

From the Site:
[OSGeo-Live](http://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html) is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual Machine based on Xubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated and passed around.

It [provides pre-configured applications for a range of geospatial use cases](http://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/overview.html), including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation of data. It also contains sample datasets and documentation.
