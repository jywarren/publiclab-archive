# SnapPiCam: a Raspberry Pi Point & Shoot

###What I want to do
I discovered the [SnapPiCam](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-SnapPiCam-A-Raspberry-Pi-Camera/?ALLSTEPS), a project to make a point and shoot Raspberry Pi camera, through [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/blog/2014/02/07/the-snappicam-a-raspberry-pi-camera-raspberry_pi-piday-raspberrypi/). I ordered the parts used by the project team, and am going to make my own with some modifications.  Specifically, I want to make it work without the touch screen, which is the most expensive part, and see what other parts can be stripped/redesigned in from the project.

###Why I'm interested
I want a point and shoot Raspberry Pi Infragram cam, and I want to continue exploring the feasibility of making our [Point and Shoot Kickstarter Reward](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/infragram-the-infrared-photography-project) with a Pi inside.
