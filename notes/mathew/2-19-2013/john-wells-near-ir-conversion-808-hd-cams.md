# John Wells Near IR conversion for 808 HD Cams

John Wells is doing great things with keychain cams over at the West Lothian Archaeological Society.  Above is his simple pendulum rig made from a coat hanger for the cheap 808 keychain HD cams.  The top part is wrapped around the kite line to stay in place.

[He has also documented his instructions for converting them to near IR.](http://www.armadale.org.uk/808dinfraredconversion.htm)
