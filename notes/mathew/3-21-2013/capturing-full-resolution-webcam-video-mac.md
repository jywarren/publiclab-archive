# Capturing full resolution webcam video on a mac

[Quicky](http://b-l-a-c-k-o-p.com/Quicky.html) is a wonderful app that unleashes the Quicktime framework to do full-quality video recording out of a webcam at whatever the webcam's max resolution is.  I am so happy this exists, saving me the time of making my own crappy quartz composer app. 

I used it to take a full-res movie with my spectrometer, then exported the movie to an image sequence with Quicktime 7.  I wish I could skip that last step...
