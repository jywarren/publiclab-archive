# Spectrometer 3.0 add-on v2 

Finally got around to designing a more accurate and easier to use cuvette add-on ,same overall design but modified how the light samples attaches to the cuvette holder. Also changed the light source, the dollar general laser was not easy enough to modify so I went to a Walmart flash light which was one a dollar a piece. The circuit board used in the Walmart flashlight was more accurate to modify. I've purchased several flashlights and converted them over to different specific light spectrums such as : RGB led , White Led , UV , IR . The flashlight has 9 leds installed but I remove 8 of them and just modify the center one.

If anyone is interested in trying it out i'm planning on making 2 or 3 of these and will happily send a few out for people a try . ( send me a message looking for feedback )

I didnt get a photo of it but this also attaches to the spectrometer with a 3d printed magnet mount.![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/024/245/large/29829829_10156168759555995_2021045469_o.jpg "29829829_10156168759555995_2021045469_o.jpg")![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/024/246/large/29748606_10156168760040995_1250387487_o.jpg "29748606_10156168760040995_1250387487_o.jpg")![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/024/247/large/29829766_10156168767600995_247265734_o.jpg "29829766_10156168767600995_247265734_o.jpg")
