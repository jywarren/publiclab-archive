# How i was getting different captured images in presence or absence of sun light ?

Hello, 

I want to make infragram camera using i-ball web cam to measure NDVI INDEX.So,I had purchase 20-Mega pixel i-ball usb web camera.To replicate infragram camera,i had replace the IR filter with rosco #19 fire filter(Red) as per suggestion of public-lab 's below link

To test this camera result,I had capture images in presence or absence of sunlight.
1) In presence of sunlight,I get below attached image(Outdoor_image.jpg).

2) In absence of sunlight( or low sun light ),I get below attached image(indoor_image.jpg).

I was getting totally different images in absence or present of sun light.

So,requested to address my below quire

1) what are the reasons for getting these kind of image difference in presence or absent of sunlight ?

Any help in this case is appreciated.
