# Feasibility-check: NDVI analysis of moss

Dear Public Lab community,

  
first of all: I just stumbled upon this website and I am impressed by how extremely thorough the projects and works done in this context are.

  
I am a researcher myself, looking for a method to estimate the photosynthesis rate of moss. The images I work with are recorded under lab conditions, so I have control over the light setting. I would like to be able to see, how the photosynthesis of the moss is affected by changing different parameters (light, humidity, airflow, ...).   

  
My question is: How sensitive is the algorythm in terms of color-gradients. If the color of my moss changes slightly, will I be able to detect it?

  
On the images, solely moss and substrate will be visible. I would like to grow the moss at the same time I am evaluating the photosynthesis rate. Will the change in plant/substrate ratio on the images alter the analysis?

  
I assume these questions are quite simple but I would like to know, if I can use this technique in my studies before I dive into it.

  
Best,

Erik
