# Solid Waste Facilities in California

Here is a blog post outlining ways to obtain data to display the solid waste facilities in California using CalRecycle Data. I used several well-known data analysis tools such as _python_ (requests, pandas, beautifulsoup) for general web scraping, _plotly_ libraries for graphs, and _ArcMap_ _Online_ to produce the main graphic.
