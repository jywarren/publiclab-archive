# Enforcement on inactive permits?

We ([MMMP](https://publiclab.org/wiki/the-mountains-and-mines-monitoring-project)!) are looking for avenues for accountability on unclaimed abandoned mine land in West Virginia. Specifically, we're thinking about cases where permit violations and hazards occur on inactive mine sites: what strategies can you think of to get regulatory agencies to take action? Any examples of folks successfully getting a response in cases like this?
