# Carbon dioxide monitoring near LAX

Through a partnership of [LA Makerspace](http://www.lamakerspace.com), [YouthBuild Charter](http://www.youthbuildcharter.org/), and [From Lot To Spot](http://fromlottospot.org/) we recently did a project to measure and map carbon dioxide concentrations near LAX.

Project details and results are hosted [here](http://scienceland.wikispaces.com/FLTS).
