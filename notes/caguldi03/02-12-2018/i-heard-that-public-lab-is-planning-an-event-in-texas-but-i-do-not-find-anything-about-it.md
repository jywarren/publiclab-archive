# I heard that Public Lab is planning an event in Texas, but I do not find anything about it.

In North Texas we have a number of groups that are exploring air monitoring but are not connected to PublicLab. I heard that you are planning a barn raising in Texas. I'd love to know more and spread the word here, but I do not see anything like that on your site. But then I have difficulty navigating the site. Maybe I am missing it.
