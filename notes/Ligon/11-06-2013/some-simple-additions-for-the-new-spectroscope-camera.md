# Some simple additions for the new spectroscope camera

I had a bit of a problem with keeping the new camera in place, so I placed several pieces of thin (1/4 inch) styrofoam on each side of the wooden support block and shimmed it with cardboard to keep the block in place.  I also added a tripod screw attachment by placing two appropriate nuts (1/4 inch), one on top of the other just in front of the hole where the cable comes out.  I at first planned to use epoxy, but I found that Superglue seems to be adequate and sets much faster.  The tripod attachment makes life much easier.  I will add photos if anyone is interested.
