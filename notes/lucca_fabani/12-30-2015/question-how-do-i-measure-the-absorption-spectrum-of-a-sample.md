# Question: How do I measure the absorption spectrum of a sample?

I am starting a project for school (8th grade science project) and need to measure the absorption spectrum of methylene blue. Now I am struggling to subtract th backlight source from my spectrum. the video in the website does not look like my browser settings... any help appreciated.

Thanks!
