# Balloons for Mapping

Lightweight Polyurethane Balloons

[Arizona Balloon](http://www.arizonaballoon.com) has manufactured these for years and they are used by universities and companies for aerial mapping. The polyurethane is very light weight, thus requiring much less helium than nylon or PVC balloons.

They have made balloons with an attached rudder that is preferred by some individuals.
Next a twin rudder system is under development.
