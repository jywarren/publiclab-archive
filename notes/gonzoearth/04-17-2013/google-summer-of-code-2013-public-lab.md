# Google Summer of Code 2013 & Public Lab

Public Lab is happy to announce that we are part of the Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2013 program!

This program introduces students from colleges and universities around the world to open source software development through a stipend for summer coding on selected mentored projects. 

We need your help in developing the projects and recruiting students!
