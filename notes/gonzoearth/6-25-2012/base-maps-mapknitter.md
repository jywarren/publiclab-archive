# Base maps in MapKnitter

Microsoft (Bing) put out a press release today announcing that they have more than doubled their existing aerial imagery library.
It's a great time to remind users that MapKnitter has more than just the default base map layer for stitching imagery. The "choose background layer" button button on the toolbar brings up a map layers menu.
