# balloon rigging

Setting up a new balloon from Southern Balloon Works and thinking about where-how to initially attach the camera. The balloon come with the black cross member seen in the photo. I rigged the line here with the outer balloon attachment points and the cross is configured to maintain separation and balance among the attachment points.
And now to set up a camera with this platform for the first time. Among available options; 4 additional inner attachment points on the balloon itself (seen in photo), the cross, and the line itself.
