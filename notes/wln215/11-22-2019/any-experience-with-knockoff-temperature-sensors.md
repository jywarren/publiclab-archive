# Any experience with knockoff temperature sensors?

I ran into this [GitHub article][1] on counterfeit DS18B20 sensors. Basically the "jellybean" temperature sensor that comes in waterproof probes. I usually get mine in small quantities from Adafruit but this raises some questions for making kits in bulk.
