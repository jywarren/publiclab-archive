# DIY Desktop Spectrometer - camera quit working after two days of usage

After two days of using the Desktop Spectrometer received because backing the Kickstarter project the camera quit working. The LED diode works, it is recognized with the software but shows nothing. After couple of hours of trying to make it work again I have decided to buy a new camera. I have chosen Genius FaceCam 1320 as it seemed to be compact, easy to open and remove the IR filter, high resolution and manual focus.

It was easy to unmount the stand and open the body of the camera. I removed the lens with IR filter BUT it is not possible to remove IR filter only so I took a wooden skewer and applied pressure on the IR filter which then cracked and was easily removed.

Only problem the camera is slightly bigger, so it does not fit into the original body. I am still glad I have the original kit because now it is easy to build a new spectrometer for me. 

I will join you tomorrow with the new device made by me. I will share some pictures of the device and begin taking some spectra.
