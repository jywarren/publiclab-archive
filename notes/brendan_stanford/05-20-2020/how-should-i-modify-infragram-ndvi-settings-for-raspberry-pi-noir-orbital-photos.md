# How should I modify Infragram NDVI settings for Raspberry Pi Noir orbital photos?

![image description](/i/39449.jpg "2020-05-20T13_43_05.679Z.jpg")

I am a middle school teacher looking to use NDVI for the first time with my code club students. The picture below of the coast of Newfoundland, Canada was taken with a Raspberry Pi Noir near-IR camera as part of the 2020 Astro Pi: Mission space lab competition, and we wanted to use NDVI to infer the relative health of plant populations at different latitudes. However, when we use the NDVI colorized preset on Infragram as in the photo above, we can barely see any of the plant population which we know are present. How can we modify the NDVI settings to enhance the appearance of plant populations? Thanks for any help you can provide!![image description](/i/39448.jpg "canadians_space_lab95.jpg")
