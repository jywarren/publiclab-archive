# normal or noIR camera?

Hi I am waiting for the lego to arrive and have the raspberry with raspi camera v2\. Considering there is the pi noIR camera from raspi isn' that a more interesting option for the spectrometer in general because of the larger range of the spectrum? Is there an advantage of the normal camera?
