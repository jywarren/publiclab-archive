# Question: Why won't the spectrum plot show once the image has been uploaded?

I took a spectrum with a spectrometer attached to my phone. I then uploaded it (successfully) onto the site yet the graph and calibration interface didn't turn up. The only possible issue I can think of is that the spectral lines are slightly tilted.

Why doesn't the plot show, and does anyone know a way to fix it?
