# What is the process of teachers becoming moderators at PublicLab.org?

As a part of my GSoC project - Refine User Interfaces across PublicLab.org, the process of teachers becoming moderators needs to be streamlined. I wonder what is currently the process of teachers becoming moderators? Also, what is expected while refining the process?

Thanks!
