# PAHs spectra

Dear friends! I am looking for a base with spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydroharbons. The HITRAN base has no relevant data. Likewise searchlight.semrock.com , spectra.arizona.edu and nightsea.com do not contain PAHs spectra. First, I need EPA PAHs spectra (csv file will be the best solution). Please, give me any information how I can get these data.Thank you in advice!
