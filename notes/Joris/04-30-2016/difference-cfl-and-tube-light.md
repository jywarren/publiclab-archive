# Difference CFL and Tube light?

###What I want to do or know
In the advanced calibration video, it is emphasized that a CFL is needed for calibration, and that a regular old "straight & long" tube light is a lesser choice. At first glance the blue peaks appear to be smaller or more spread out.

I always thought they are essentially the same, just in a different form factor. Can someone enlighten (all pun intended) me as to the difference, both in a calibration sense and in the physics/chemistry root cause?
