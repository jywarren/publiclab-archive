# Question: desktop spectrometer 3.0 light sensitivity

###What I want to do or know
My desktop spectrometer 3 (using the public lab kit) appears to work, but it requires a lot of light. Pointing it directly at a bright sky works, but holding it at a slight angle immediately kills the signal. Same story with a bright light: holding it right up to the light works, anything indirect fails.

From the videos and articles I have the impression others' kits have higher sensitivity?  How can I check/optimize my setup?

I'm using the collimation slit from the kit (0.2mm?).
