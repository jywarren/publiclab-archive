# Cancer Problems: Meet Cancer Alley

### Introduction:  

We are a group of three 9th grade students looking into Cancer Alley, a small area in Louisiana between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. People living there are 50 times more likely to get cancer than in other areas around the world. This is all due to the massive amount of pollution around the area from large companies and factories.  

### Our main concern:

Our main concern is how the pollution and high cancer rates in this area affect peoples' daily lives.

### Obstacles and supporting information:

Our obstacles are the limited amount of free time we have, getting to Cancer Alley in order to do research, and obtaining instruments to record data about the air quality.   

### Who is engaged in this concern?

Sharon Lavigne, founder of a protest group named "Coalition Against Cancer Alley", and other locals inside of Cancer Alley, such as Robert Taylor and Dorothy Jenkins ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/louisiana-cancer-alley-photos-oil-refineries-chemicals-pollution-2019-11 "https://www.businessinsider.com/louisiana-cancer-alley-photos-oil-refineries-chemicals-pollution-2019-11")). These people are focused mainly on trying to stop these factories and companies from polluting the area.

### What are the initial questions?

1. What are the chemicals in the air?
2. What's the radius of Cancer Alley?
3. How many people are affected?
4. Why are the chemicals that are released so dangerous?
5. Why do they still allow people to live in this area if cancer cases are more likely than the rest of the world?
6. How are these companies able to pollute the area without legal action being taken against them?  
7. Does it affect animals?
