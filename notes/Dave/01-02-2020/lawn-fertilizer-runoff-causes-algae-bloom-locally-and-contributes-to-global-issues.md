# Lawn Fertilizer Runoff Causes Algae Bloom Locally and Contributes to Global Issues

### 

**Introduction:**

Over application of fertilizer to
lawns causes nutrient runoff into local ponds, lakes, streams, and
rivers. This results in algee blooms that are damaging to the
environment.

**Our
main concern:**

Excess fertilizer runoff damages
both local and regional water ways. The issue is wide spread and at the
same time local. Water runoff from local lawns eventually flows into the
Ohio River and from there contributes to algee blooms in the Gulf of Mexico.

**Obstacles
and supporting information:**

Home owners have limited knowledge
about this topic and even less ability to know what to do about this
issue.

There are professional tests that
can be conducted on soil to test levels of phosphorous and nitrogen.
However, these are costly (about $20/sample) and directed mostly to
professional farmers in the region.

Many homes have been built on soil
that is high in clay which contributes to fertilizer runoff. Sometimes
this is aggravated by local developers stripping the top surface layer of top
soil off the land during the development process.

**Who
is engaged in this concern?**

There are some efforts to educate
farmers in the region. An example is here.

There are local businesses that
offer organic fertilizer options for home owners and offer a limited supply of
free soil test kits are part of their marketing techniques.

I do not know of any local
non-profit resources directed at homeowners.

Manufacturers of home lawn fertilizer
give specific directions for use on the label. But based on visual
evidence the aggregate community over use of fertilizers is significant.

**What
are the initial questions?**

Has anyone attempted to address this
issue via Public Lab or similar?

What can be reapplied from similar
topics?

Are there low cost citizen science
sensors available to help measure and quantify the issue? If not, does
anyone have ideas on how to develop a low cost sensor to measure phosphorus
and/or nitrogen?
