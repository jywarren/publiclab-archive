# Pressure sensor for depth controller

Hello,

I am studying mechanical engineering in Malaysia. I am working on the development of the underwater vehicle. I have purchased a 9 axis IMU, a stepper motor for internal moving mass and now want to purchase a pressure sensor for depth control of 4 meters. Can anyone guide me what type pressure sensor which is easily interfaced with LabVIEW and give me the precise measurement for maximum depth of 4 meters? Additionally can anyone please send me the complete module f controlling buoyancy engine and internal moving mass with depth control for laboratory scale glider?

Best regards
