Survive is the essentials to give your life 

Marine Biome/ Hydrosphere is made mostly of saltwater oceans and is the largest biome on Earth. Ocean plants provide more than half of the oxygen on earth. Animals that live freshwater cannot survive in saltwater (vice versa). The world's major land biomes include tropical rain forest, tropical dry forest, tropical savanna, desert, temperate grassland, temperate woodland and shrubland, temperate forest, northwestern coniferous forest, boreal forest, saltwater, freshwater and tundra.
