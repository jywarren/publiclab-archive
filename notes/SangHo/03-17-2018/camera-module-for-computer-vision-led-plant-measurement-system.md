# Camera module for Computer Vision/LED Plant Measurement System

I have question in [Computer Vision plant measurement System](https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/03-15-2018/computer-vision-led-plant-measurement-system) by @MaggPi  
I only have [raspberry pi camera rev 1.3](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1367) and wonder it works with that. And how can I google proper software of simpleCV?
