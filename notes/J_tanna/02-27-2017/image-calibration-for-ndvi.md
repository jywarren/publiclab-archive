# Image Calibration For NDVI 

###What I want to do or know
I am beginner in image processing and working with NIR images of farm taken by drone. From the reading I came to know that for plant health measurement I need to apply NDVI Index on the image. But before that I need to calibrate the Image. So, that NDVI gives proper output. By searching on internet I came to know about gamma correction. It can or can not be one of the step.So, what are the steps that I need to apply for image calibration for NDVI
