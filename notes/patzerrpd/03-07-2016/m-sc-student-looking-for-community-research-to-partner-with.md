# M.Sc. student looking for community research to partner with

Hello! 

My name is Stephanie and I am an M.Sc. candidate studying Rural Planning and Development at the University of Guelph in Canada. I stumbled upon this collaborative science community which seems like an amazing space for community organizing around environmental protection. 

I am currently seeking research projects in which to partner with regarding the ability for community managed environmental initiatives to be successful and sustainable. 

If any project could use some academic/research support, please reach out to see if your research needs could match mine. I am open to all kinds of projects. I should also mention that I have a background in civil and environmental engineering, focused mostly on water distribution, water and wastewater treatment and water systems. 

You can reach me here or at my email spatzer@uoguelph.ca

Cheers!
Stephanie
