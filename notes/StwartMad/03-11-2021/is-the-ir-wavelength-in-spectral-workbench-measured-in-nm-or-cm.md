# Is the ir wavelength in spectral workbench measured in nm or cm?

I am wondering if the spectral workbench measured infrared wavelength in nanometers or centimeters. I am trying to figure out with both my tests if I have Carbon Nanotubes or not by using other researcher's graph results and type of measurement does matter alot
