# Picayune Make Meeting Notes for 16 August 2014

###Event details

This was the focus of the meeting.  Participants drew a design with a permanent marker on a small circuit board and the exposed copper was etched away.  This illustrates the process of making a circuit board that you can attach components to.

The etchant consists of swimming pool acid and hydrogen peroxide.  The proportions and safety considerations are readily available on the internet so do your research and be careful.

Some pennys were partially immersed in the solution to see what would happen.

We meet the first and third Saturday of the month at 5:00pm at the Kimono Dragon in Picayune.  This meeting was supported by a grant to Public Lab organizers by Rackspace.  The grant was used to purchase electronic components and supplies to build complex circuits.


###Background

The turnout totaled 12 with a very diverse age range from elementary school to retired.

We are looking forward to future meetings where we will convert an old toaster oven into a solder oven to attach surface mount components to the circuit boards.
