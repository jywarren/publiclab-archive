# Easy Cut Delta Kite simplification

Wintercamp activities included working on simplifying the kite build.  From the left.  A pocket for the spar spreader that we were not really happy with.  Next is the mini-caribener and pex plastic pipe.  This was the standard attachment.  The solution we arrived with eliminated the additional parts.  Next are 3 mock-ups of folded pockets.  The last item is the almost final form.

Here is another view of the almost final solution.  Instead of cutting a notch in the edge we used a hole punch for a tear resistant hole

Here is the final solution.

There is a hole in the kite material that the loop of string passes thru.  The string wraps around the edge spar with a small piece of kite material making a pocket for the string.  The spreader has a grove cut in the end like an arrow into which the looped string is placed.
