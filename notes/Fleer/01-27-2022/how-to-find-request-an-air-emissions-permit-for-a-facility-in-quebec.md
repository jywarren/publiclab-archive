# How to find/request an air emissions permit for a facility in Quebec?

I am trying to find out what quantities of air pollution a facility is permitted to emit. I know how to do this for facilities located in many U.S. states but am unfamiliar with the process in the Canadian provinces. Is there an equivalent to FOIA in Quebec? Or a records repository online that I have not yet found? Thanks in advance to anyone with info on this topic.
