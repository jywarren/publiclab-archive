# What Are Some Important Tools/Resources in an Environmental Emergency Response?

As we get ready for this July's Barnraising and Crisis Convening, I'm wondering what kinds of tools people have found valuable to have on hand in the hours, days and weeks after a crisis or emergency: specifically one where there is an urgent need to respond to or document environmental threats.   

  
Obviously the tools folks might use in a response would vary depending on the nature of the emergency and the place where it's unfolding, but I'm curious: what kinds of things have been of most use to folks who have first-hand experience in crisis events? What would you NOT recommend? In retrospect, are there things that you wish you had had with you?
