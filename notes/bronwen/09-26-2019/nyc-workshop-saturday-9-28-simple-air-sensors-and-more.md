# NYC Workshop Saturday, 9/28: Simple Air Sensors and More!

Join us this weekend at the WEPA Festival between 1-6pm, where we'll be demonstrating Public Lab's Simple Air Sensors (and more!). Learn about ways that  DIY environmental tools can help you explore your environment, engage with your neighbors, and conduct investigations about the place where you live. 

Along with Public Lab, CADRE Artist, Sadie Prego, designer and educator with Queens Public Library will be there to share examples of her work with with community science tools. Hope to see you there!
