# Help the Kits Initiative launch the Basic Microscope Kit by 3d printing lens adaptors!

The Kits Initiative is looking for 3-D printing enthusiasts to help us source parts for the Basic Microscope Kit!

We're investigating possibilities for sourcing the 3-D printed components of the Microscope Kit (coming soon!) and are interested in seeing if there are community members who might be interested in contracting with the Kits Initiative to supply some of these parts.

The print files can be found below:

If you think you might be interested in pitching in, drop us a line at [kits@publiclab.org](mailto:kits@publiclab.org) so that we can discuss price, timelines, etc!
