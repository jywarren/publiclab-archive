# GLAM and Gowanus Canal Conservancy Goal Setting Meeting

On Wednesday, 8/13, members of GLAM, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy, and Public Lab met to discuss goal setting for the near future. Thus far, mapping efforts have focused on the following: 

•	Documenting historical sites
•	Monitoring vegetation 
•	Assessing the efficacy of green spaces, and locating opportunities for future ones
•	Locating and identifying the sources of pollution in the canal
•	Serving as a community engagement project, and raising awareness of the canal

A near goal is to map the entire length of the canal (most likely to attempt in this fall). In the coming months we also hope to:

•	Identify and prioritize future study sites
•	ID vacant lots suitable for sewer diversion (before hitting floodzones)
•	Continue conversations with stakeholders, and build new relationships with community groups and local organizations.
•	Create an interactive map documenting points of interest along the Gowanus

Stay tuned for more information and chances to get involved this fall!
