# A New Balloon and Kite Mapping campaign: Kickstarter Gold and Beyond!

**We'v**e **just launched a new kite and balloon mapping project** as a part of _Kickstarter Gold_, a new initiative designed to help highlight the evolution of initiatives that have received funding in the past.

We're obviously very excited to have the chance to share the work that Public Lab community members have done over the years: developing tools and methodologies for community-led research, and creating a robust and supportive environment for new kinds of investigation, information access, and advocacy.

Over the next few weeks, we'll be getting the word out about our existing balloon and kite kits that you all have done so much with, as well as a few new "prototyping" versions, using smaller kites and balloons. We're looking forward to drawing some attention to a set of tools we're really proud of, and are excited about connecting to a large audience about the ways that community driven science can happen where it's needed.

Please help us get the word out -- and in the coming days, we'll be following up to ask for more input as well, as we'd love to highlight all your amazing work and balloon-mapping stories! Take a look at our press release [here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/public-lab-launches-balloon-mapping-kit-campaign-with-kickstarter-gold), and visit our campaign at the link below.
