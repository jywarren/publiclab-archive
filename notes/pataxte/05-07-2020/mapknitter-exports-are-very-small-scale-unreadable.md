# mapknitter exports are very small scale, unreadable

Re #mapknitter , when
I try the new cloud export function i get a teeny tiny unreadable image
in both tif and jpg formats, and this is true no matter what resolution
I choose, from 25 to 110 cm/pixel. Why is this occurring and what can I
do to fix it?
Thx
