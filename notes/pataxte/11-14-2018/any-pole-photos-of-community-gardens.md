# Any pole photos of community gardens?

We have a book coming out (publisher in the UK, CABI.org),
title Food Gardens for a Changing World re science-based food gardening responding
to environmental, climate, and social changes in ways consistent with values
and shared hopes for the future. It would be great to have a pole-mapped photo
of a community garden for the cover. If you have something and are interested
in more details about the book please let me know. Thanks!
