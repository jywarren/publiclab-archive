# balloon and kite mapping

Anyone in the LA area with solid balloon and kite mapping experience? Would you be willing to train me to strengthen my skills? If so, please be in touch.

Thanks

  
I'm in Santa Barbara, will use this for my own work and for teaching and doing projects with students and NGOs
