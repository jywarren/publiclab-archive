# How to save and return to a map, and uploaded images in Mapknitter

I started making a map, including uploading about 15 images. Computer shut down. Now returning to Mapknitter there's no trace of the map when I log in. How can a map be saved? Can it be saved under the user who created it? Where is it? Thx!
