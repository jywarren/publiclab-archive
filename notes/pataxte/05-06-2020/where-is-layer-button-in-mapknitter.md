# where is layer button in mapknitter?

Mapknitter used to display a layer button in the mini menu you get for an image you have put on the map. It allowed you to put one image on top of others it overlaps with. I can't find that function anymore, just the opaque vs semi transparent option.

Any help is appreciated!
