# mapknitter export stuck

Trying to export a couple of maps on mapknitter but they have gotten stuck in the compositing stage. They are high res (@warren helped me with this a couple of weeks ago). Export seemed to be working fine, and then stuck over the last couple of days. Map is "2020\_bean\_bed"

thx
