# Soil Samples

Yesterday we did an Soil sample experiment to learn if the soil is contaminated at West St John High School. I learned that cross contamination of different soils can mess up the experiment. I also learned that once we collected our soil samples we had to use protective gloves so we wouldn't contaminate the soil with bacteria. This is what I learned yesterday.
