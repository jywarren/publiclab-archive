# Looking for water controller resource 

Am looking for some resources to embed a microcontroller inside an air to water dispenser.

  
Would like to sense water and filter quality and humidity and time of day to produce an intelligent schedule and preventive maintenance. System must have an SMS or WiFi option to interact with the device and account profile.

  
Looking for a hands on engineer to help out.
