# Could it be used on bikess to understand the air quality from our precious machines (cars)

Air quality of my town and differences in air quality at a fine scale during bike commutes and training rides. Help show the real impacts at a local scale from our car dependent culture and to help shed light on the air quality issues effecting our children!
###Background story
