# Soil Contaminant Testing 

I'm looking into options for soil testing that are more accessible 
but also reliable, and am curious about what folks out there have been 
using to test soils for heavy metals, PAH's, and other oil and gas 
related contaminants. Have you used colorimeters, spectometers, reagants
or something else to characterize these in soils? Do you know of any 
extension offices, agencies or makers spaces offering cheap soil 
contaminant testing? Which guidelines do you use to compare your soil 
test results to in terms of contaminant limits?  

  
I'll
be at the Barnraising in Houston and hoping we can get together to 
explore soil testing options- what can we further develop to be more 
usable and give us better results? If you have experience with soil 
testing for contaminants, please be in touch and lets work on this 
together!
