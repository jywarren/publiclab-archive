# What are the best settings for a Camera?

Hello,

I built a USB Camera-based spectrometer. I a; getting different results for each setting. I want to get the image/spectrum the closest possible to a CCD spectrometer. I would like to know how to set the gain, white balance, saturation ...

Any advice or help ?
