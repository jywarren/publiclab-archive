# Different approaches......

Apparently, I am lost in the world of NDVI images. I need to figure out how to find the LUTs for images created in the sandbox.

The two images attached are my efforts.

The grey image seems to show only plant mass, while the colorized shows extra reflectance of bare soil.

I am interested in mapping using a small UAS with a modified MOBIUS with the PL red filter. Any guidance would be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance.
