# Modified MOBIUS with PL red filter

###What I want to do: I am trying to do NDVI for crop scouting in AZ, and I am using a modified Mobius camera with red filter.

###My attempt and results: I keep loosing the PL page that has a screen shot of the proper settings for white balance. I am using R=310, G=500, B=700. This is the raw image that my settings captured.

###Questions and next steps: I am in need of some help to see if my images are coming out correctly or not.

###Why I'm interested: I want to be able to use the Modified Mobius with the PL red filter and get great NDVI images that have value.
