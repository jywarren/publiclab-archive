# Lavender in full bloom

I am attempting to use the HSV color wheel for actual NDVI.

Here is one of the images that I processed on PL.

Will this work as an actual NDVI image? I am looking for a LUTs for this image. The color wheel is enormous, and I have probably overlooked the proper way to scale this.

I have many images that i would like to use HSV function on PL. Some people have had problems with HSV, based on posts, but it seems to work well for my purpose of gathering NIR with a MOBIUS, using a red filter.
Thoughts?
