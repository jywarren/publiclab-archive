# Samsung PL57 conversion

I attempted to convert an old Samsung PL57 camera which I had available, but failed miserably. This is not a model that lends itself well to the conversion. After taking off the back, I had to remove another three layers to get anywhere near the infrared filter, which turned out to be impossible to remove without either disassembling the entire camera or wrecking it. Don't use this model. I'm going to have to find a different camera. I'm reluctant to convert my nice canon ixus that I've been using for years :(
