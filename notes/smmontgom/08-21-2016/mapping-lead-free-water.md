# Mapping Lead-Free Water

As I'm sure folks on this forum are aware, [lead is toxic](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/lead-poisoning-why-lead-p_b_609383.html), particularly in children where it can cause permanent brain damage leading to reduced IQ, ADHD, symptoms of autism, and memory disruption, among many other problems. Recently lead has been [showing up in our drinking water](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/nearly-2000-water-systems-fail-lead-tests/81220466/) all across the country, and officials have been found systematically delaying and even [falsifying public testing records](http://gothamist.com/2016/06/25/city_found_to_have_falsified_water.php).

We recently launched [CitizenSpring](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1278368968/citizenspring-app-to-crowdsource-and-map-safe-drin) on Kickstarter to provide an app that empowers individuals to test their water and crowdsource the data to see where it's safe for us and our families to drink and to hold our public officials accountable.

We have **10 days left** on our [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1278368968/citizenspring-app-to-crowdsource-and-map-safe-drin) and very much need your support.

If you know anybody in the media/blogosphere, particularly that are into tech-mom/dad or social-good/citizen-science type projects or projects more generally that use technology to solve real world problems (and also think that kids getting brain damage is a bummer), please send them our campaign information. Please send an email to outreach@citizenspring.org if you'd like to get our press kit or connect directly about potential partnership/synergy with projects you're working on.

Thanks, Sean
