# Project planning and community thriving

### Taking our community to the next level

### I live in a community that is getting mature and ready to start planning for bigger projects - an ecovillage and a more sustainable work organisation

### How to add an extra level of planning without making the current day to day work more diffucult?

### Thriving communities that demonstrate ways of sustainable living together is a way to make a smooth transition to a more sustainable situation on the planet!
