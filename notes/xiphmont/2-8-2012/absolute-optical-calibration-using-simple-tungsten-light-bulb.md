# ABSOLUTE OPTICAL CALIBRATION USING A SIMPLE TUNGSTEN LIGHT BULB

The attached paper shows how to use a tungsten-filament incandescent (a commonly available lamp that provides a particularly close physical approximation to an ideal black-body radiator) for absolute photometric calibration of a spectrophotometer.  

The paper presents results of a physical experiment that achieved accuracy of 15% (and suggests the data was worse than it would otherwise have been due to stray light contamination).
