# Do you think this would work for a webcam feed?

Sorry, I'm don't yet fully understand the ins and outs of webGl.  A high frame rate isn't essential, but does need to be from a live feed.  I'll have a bash at getting it to work, but it would be great to hear if you think it'll never work because of X, or it should work fine.  Either way it'd be great to know.

Cheers

Chris
