# CSV files from spectra

What are the units in the CSV files?  The wavelengths are provided in the far left, but the values for the blue, green, and red peaks are different from the %intensity that can be obtained from scrolling along the spectra graphs with the mouse.  The values are over 100, so it doesn't appear to be the % transmittance.  The values are also too high for absorbance.  Could someone please clarify for me?  Thank you.
