# Newtown Creek Workshop with Balloon Photography


http://www.newtowncreekalliance.org/april-12th-north-henry-st-workshop/

Please join the Newtown Creek Alliance on April 12th for a hands-on workshop as part of our North Henry Street Planning Project. The afternoon will include aerial mapping, background lectures on the ecology and conditions of the site and a workshop to envision future scenarios of public access and shoreline restoration. A key component of our planning process is input from local residents, so we want you to come and share your ideas! The events will occur outdoors on site.
