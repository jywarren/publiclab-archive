# AirQualityEgg sensor-box for real-time air column monitoring

This sensor system is a modification of the Air Quality Egg's outside air pollution sensor box (airqualityegg.com), designed to add additional capabilities relevant for air column monitoring.  The system contains sensors for reading NO2, CO, temperature, humidity, compass (for calculating wind direction), wind speed, dust (particulate matter), VOC's, altitude, and O3 and streams the data in real-time via XBee to Pachube.com.

It should be noted that the sensors are uncalibrated, so the data can only be interpreted by analyzing trends.

A detailed list of the sensors and components, with part numbers and links to web retailers for purchase, is attached.
