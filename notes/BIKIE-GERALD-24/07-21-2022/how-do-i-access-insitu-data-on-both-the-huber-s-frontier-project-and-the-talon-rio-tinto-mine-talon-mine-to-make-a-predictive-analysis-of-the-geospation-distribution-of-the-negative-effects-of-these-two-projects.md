# How do I access insitu data on both the Huber’s Frontier Project and the Talon-Rio Tinto Mine (Talon Mine) to make a predictive analysis of the geospation distribution of the negative effects of these two projects?

Satellite remote sensing and geospatial data science constitute a very important tool in such project since they both enable the synoptic analysis and the time series understanding of projects with this level of complexity.  
  
Institution:Geospatial solution  
Needed ressources:insitu data  
Motives for the interest:To solve community challenges
