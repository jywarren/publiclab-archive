# Who can I reach out to for community science app UI help? 

Collaborators and I have been working on an app that can be used to read inexpensive badges to understand chemical levels in your air. The team has been working hard on creating a robust algorithm that works in many lighting conditions and with many types of phones. Here is the code for both the android and ISO https://github.com/publiclab/SmART-Form/

  
Currently we're focused on formaldehyde but the app could easily be applied to other chemicals like H2S.

  
We're finding that we could really use the help of designers and UI experts in organizing all of the information and input fields, and make using the app more intuitive esp for novice web users. Any thoughts on communities we could reach out to?
