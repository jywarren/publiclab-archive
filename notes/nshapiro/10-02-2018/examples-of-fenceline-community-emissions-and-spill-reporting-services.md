# Examples of fenceline community emissions and spill reporting services?

I'm looking for examples of websites, hotlines, or text-message platforms that enable fenceline communities to report fugitive emissions or spills. I'm also interested in the ways that the services do and don't work and ideas about how they can be improved upon if they are open source.   

  
I'm aware of a few project but I'm sure there are more! Here's what I'm already aware of:  

  
- The Louisiana Bucket Brigade's iWitness Pollution map  map.labucketbrigade.org
- The Fair Tech Collective's Air Watch Bay Area ([research note](https://publiclab.org/notes/ottinger/08-30-2018/website-for-public-data)) AirWatchBayArea.org   
- @gretchengehrke has posted a [nice note](https://publiclab.org/notes/gretchengehrke/02-21-2017/epa-method-9-visual-determination-of-the-opacity-of-emissions-from-stationary-sources) on how EPA method 9 might be able to be used for community reporting. 

  
Any others?
