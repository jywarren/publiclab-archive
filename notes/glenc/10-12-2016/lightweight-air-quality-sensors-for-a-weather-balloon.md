# lightweight air quality sensors for a weather balloon

I would like to put a particulate matter, CO2, humidity, or nitrogen oxides data collection device onto a weather balloon.  Do you know where I may find such sensors?  It should log the data onto an SD card, which I would retrieve after the balloon pops.  There is already GPS, temp and pressure sensing on board, as part of the balloon kit.

I teach one class at Woodbury University this semester:  intro environmental science for non-majors.  The school gave me $700 to get a weather balloon kit, and I am collaborating with a local high school teacher to launch the balloon.  The kit only records temp, pressure, and altitude.  I want to gather more data, such as CO2, humidity, NOx, PM2.5, or any PM.  But I do not know if it is possible to collect such data on a weather balloon because the weight including battery must be very limited.  

Thank you.
