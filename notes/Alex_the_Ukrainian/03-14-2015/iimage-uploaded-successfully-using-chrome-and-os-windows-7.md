# IImage uploaded successfully using Chrome and OS Windows 7

Today I use my wife’s laptop. The browser here is Google’ Chrome and the OS is Windows 7. Also the Internet connection is significantly quicker with 4G.

And this time I had absolutely no problem with uploading (adding) the main image to my previous post.

Thank you very much to the Public Lab for this wonderful opportunity to communicate.
