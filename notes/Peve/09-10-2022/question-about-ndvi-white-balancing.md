# Question about NDVI white balancing

I would like to ask about setting the white balance in my infrared  
converted camera to red and blue filter in NDVI photography.  
  
When I am using custom white balance setting in camera, do I have to  
use  
with or without red or blue filter, when  
I am doing it?  
  
I currently use without those filters, with red or blue coloured  
cardboard paper. (I think results were close to those examples at  
your  
page)
