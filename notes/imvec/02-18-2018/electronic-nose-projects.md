# List of electronic nose projects

###What we want to do
To create a list of electronic nose projects.

###List of projects
- Mbed microcontroller: [A Compact and Low Cost Electronic Nose for Aroma Detection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690013/)
- Arduino microcontroller: [Michael Madsen electronic nose project](http://www.maskau.dk/projects/electronic-nose)
- Arduino microcontroller: [The electronic nose (TFCD project)](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Electronic-Nose-TfCd-Project/)

###Next steps
Keep growing the list. If you know another electronic nose project attach the link in the comments area so we can include it in the list.
