# Publiclab Mastodon bot

### What we want to do
Feed the Publiclab research notes into the [fediverse](https://fediverse.party) a federation os social networks free, libres and open source. Among others Mastodon, GNUsocial, Pleroma, Friendica...

### Our attempt and result
We've created a profile in the [Botsin.space](https://botsin.space) Mastodon instance focused on bots and sincronized the Publiclab feed using the [IFTTT.com](https://ifttt.com) service

Everytime a research note is posted to the lab, the note goes directly to Mastodon. 

If you are a Mastodon, GNUsocial, Pleroma, etc... user, you can now follow the lab on Mastodon at https://botsin.space/@publiclab (copy paste because the editor is doing weird things) or seach for @publiclab@botsin.space.

### Why are we interested?
Using free and open software is important for citizen autonomy.  Comunicating our projects using exclusively Twitter or Facebook makes us dependent on those multinational corporations. Privacy, data ownership and autonomy.
