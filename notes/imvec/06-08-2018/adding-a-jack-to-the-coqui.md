# Adding a jack to the Coqui

### What we want to do
Record Coqui sensor measurements.

### How to add the jack
Follow the awesome post by @akshaya and @ kanarinka to [build your own Coqui electroconductivity sensor](https://publiclab.org/notes/ashkaya/09-17-2016/build-a-coqui-a-simple-water-conductivity-sensor) and then continue here.

We've used the [Thonkiconn 3.5mm jack](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/3-5mm-jacks/) you can find on the internet an soldered two wires to facilitate it's introduction in the protoboard.

### Plug the wires as the speaker is plugged: 
·**Red wire** to Pin#3  
·**Green wire** to Ground.

## Questions and next steps
Test the recording using a known conductivity product to have a stable value that can be used as a sort of calibration. 

Do it with kids this summer ;D
