# Analizing the signal of the Coqui using Audacity

### What I want to do
Determine the frequency of the generated wave of a [Coqui device](https://publiclab.org/wiki/coqui).

### My attempt and results
AUDIO FILE → <a href="/i/25188"><i class="fa fa-file"></i> LS_51372.ogg</a>

After [recording the signal](https://publiclab.org/notes/imvec/06-09-2018/coqui-wave-audio-recording) from a Bezoya bottled water and adding some salty water to it we've imported the file into Audacity. Getting this general wave.

### Analizing a part of the wave
We've selected 1/2 second of the lowest signal (Bezoya water). You can do it directly on the timeline using the cursor or at the bottom of the interface.

Once selected, on the top menu go to "Analyze → Plot spectrum". For our low part of the wave we've got this curve.

For the high part of the wave (the salty water) this is the result.

Audacity has a lot of different patterns of analisis and options. Play around with it.

## Questions and next steps
Use a know conductivity product and... modify the coqui with a potentiometer to "tune" this known conductivity signal to a musical note?¿ Would it be possible?
