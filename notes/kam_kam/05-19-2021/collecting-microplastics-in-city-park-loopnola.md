# Collecting Microplastics in City Park #loopnola 

This past week our class took a trip to City Park to collect microplastics. People do not realize how much plastic pollution there is in our everyday life. We walked along the banks and found washed-up water bottles and other plastics. I learned from this trip that even if you only have a little trash, it adds to the bigger pile of trash.
