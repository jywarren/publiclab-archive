# Surface mount mini thermal flashlight

I am sorry I have not documented this fully yet but Jeff says I have to do work in progress in public and not wait until the end so here's the schematic of the thermal flashlight board I made and pngs for milling it if you are into that sort of thing ok more soon or probably not that soon but at some point I hope.
