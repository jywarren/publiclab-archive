# Has anyone used a RasPi camera in a DIY microscope?

I'm new to DIY scopes and  just started experimenting with one, so I'm wondering if the community had any tips? I'm also 

looking  into [USB microscopes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XNYXQHE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=techgirls-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00XNYXQHE&linkId=ee5494c5dd73e09eb57fadd458e0290c) and I'd love to know about community experiences with these as well

  
  
Context:

I mainly want to look at particulates in the air (~5-20 microns) and the pixel size of the RasPi camera is 1.4um\*1.4um
