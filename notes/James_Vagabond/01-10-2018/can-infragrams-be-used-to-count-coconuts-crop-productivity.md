# Can Infragrams be used to count coconuts/crop productivity?

I am interested in using drone mapping of coconut palm forests to assess the health and productivity of the palms.  I imagine that the ripe coconuts will have a unique IR signature and am interested in developing a software that can quantify the coconuts through compiled images.
