# Last Day!

##What was the most interesting fact you learned from this past week's activities? 

Its odd how cows produce something that harms our planet, you would never think really.
Its odd how our ozone layer is thin.The most intresting fact that we've also learned was how poisonous methane can be.We never thought about air quality and how important it is to us,but when we learned about it we discovered more.We ask many questions and now its revealed,now when people ask us questions we think about how better we can make the world.
