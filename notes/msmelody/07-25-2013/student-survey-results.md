# Student Survey Results

We did a quick survey about the air quality of the neighborhood we lived in. 

After we collected the surveys, we looked at the data and made 4 general statements based on each question:

1. A lot of people live in an area with low traffic

2. Most people live more than 10 blocks from a highway, but a good amount of people live from 0-3 blocks from a highway

3. Most people don't ever have to walk near or under a highway.

4. Most people are somewhat concerned about air quality in their neighborhood (Cypress Hills)

We're looking forward to check out the data our eggs have been collecting this past week!
