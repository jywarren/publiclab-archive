# My Balloon Mapping Experience!

It was a fantastic experience for me! The lady we collaborated with was extremely pleasant and easy to work with. During this activity, I tied the balloon shut. At first, I didn't do it tight enough so I had to redo it. I actually had to put two ties. I noticed that the balloon didn't take that long to go up 500 feet. It took about 15 minutes.
