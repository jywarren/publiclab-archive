# Replicated with Cannon A2300

It was possible to make SD bootable from camera menu. I used [ACID](http://www.zenoshrdlu.com/acid/acid.html) which was able to identify and download the firmare. Then copied it to the SD card manually and ran the "make SD card bootable" from the CHDK menu. Remember to lock the SDcard for it use CHDK.

  
Also note there are a bunch of other CHDK scripts [here](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/UBASIC/Scripts).
