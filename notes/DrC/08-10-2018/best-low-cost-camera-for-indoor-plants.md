# Best low cost camera for indoor plants?

Hello! Most of these images/tutorials are of landscape style images. I would like to use this camera in the classroom with students, allowing them to compare the health of two plants grown in two different conditions. Does this technique have the sensitivity for them to do that? If so, what is a decent, low cost camera that the community could recommend? (I need 4-6 of them, and my budget is around $200.) Ideally it would be a camera that is better for use indoors and close up photography. (We are growing Fast Plants. https://fastplants.org/) Thanks in advance for any advice!
