# Lifting capacity of PL balloon kit?

Hi Folks,

Just joined the forum so apologies if this question is a repeat. Need to work out how this forum works.

Main question.....what is the lifting capacity of the balloon kit?

I'm looking to lift approx 500 grams.

Additionally, how much rotation occurs with the balloon - obviously varies with wind.

My application is associated with retrieving data from GPS datalogger collars fitted to wildlife species.  The collars have a UHF transmitter that facilitates automatic remote download - 
see supplier website at: 
http://www.telemetrysolutions.com/data-download-automatic.php

The yagi antenna supplied is obviously directional and if the balloon does not rotate then I will miss out on connecting to collars that are not within the 'field of view' of the yagi.
Alternative solutions: 
a) use an omni antenna instead.  
b) rely on the wind to spin the balloon/yagi and leave the balloon up for several hours.
c) have some sort of gyro-linked powered motor device that rotates the yagi irrespective of balloon rotation.   I have a number of Open Pilot and DIYD flight controller boards for UAVs that may be configured to drive this system.

Thanks in advance.
