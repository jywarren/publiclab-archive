# Geologists take over Vienna

Nearly 10,000 scientists gathered in Vienna at the end of April for the annual meeting of the European Geosciences Union and I was fortunate enough to represent the Public Laboratory.  The PLOTS presentation entitled “Complete data lifecycles and citizen science integration via the Public Laboratory” generated quite a bit of interest from geomorphologists to seismologists.  Some scientists asked about how they could gather their own aerial imagery, but the vast majority of interest was in the open source nature of our data sharing.  Our data flow is distinct from traditional data sharing structures common to higher education, industry, government, and many non-profits: we want people to have our data.

Two other research notes resulted from conversations I had there with scientists:

The Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University paid for the conference registration fee.  Thank you.
