# Dowel failure on my Tyvek Delta kite

So I was at Folly Beach on Friday the 17th in 10-12 MPH winds.  I launched my 9 foot Tyvek Delta kite to watch the center spreader bar snap cleanly in half when the kite achieved maximum height and wind resistance.  The broken dowel punctured the wing when the kite folded in half.  The kite will be easy to fix, but I was concerned with how easily the dowel snapped.

The diameter is 7/16" or about 1 cm and is the one I am pointing to in the photo.  I think bamboo might have a stronger strength to weight ratio.  I might try some since I just got 500 stakes for a different project.
