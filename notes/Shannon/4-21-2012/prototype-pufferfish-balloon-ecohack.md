# Prototype 'pufferfish' balloon from EcoHack

This is the prototype that the EcoHack team- Miguel, Chris, Valerie, JD, Liz, Jeff and I came up up with for the air column monitor. We're interested in trying to make a more aerodynamic model with multiple tether points that. We're aiming for a design that is more stable than just the balloon alone and can move horizontally through the air with fluidity.
