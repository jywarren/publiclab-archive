# Water Hackathon NYC Scribble Feed

Public Lab co-sponsored the Water Hackathon in NYC this past weekend with Pachube and Ushahidi. To follow the event over the weekend, Heather Leson from Ushahidi set-up a Scribble site for feed from each day that you can check out here: http://www.scribblelive.com/Event/Water_Hackathon
