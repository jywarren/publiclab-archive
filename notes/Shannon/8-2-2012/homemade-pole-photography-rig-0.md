# Homemade pole photography rig

Jayur Mehta who is completing a PhD in archaeology at Tulane University created this pole rig to document a site that he is working on:

According to Jayur the rig was, "just a few branches held together with some stretchy cord with one of those grippy camera tripods on the end." It was used at his site which is on an active industrial soybean farm (see picture).

For more information on the project, you can read the blog post that Jayur wrote: http://jayur.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/the-great-carson-experience-part-iv-2012/
