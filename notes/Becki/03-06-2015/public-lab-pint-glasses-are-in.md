# Public Lab pint glasses are in!

What a great way to start the weekend -- UPS just delivered our pint glasses to the Portland office! We've been anxiously awaiting the arrival of these silicone glasses, custom printed for us by [Silipint](http://www.silipint.com/). They're unbreakable, making them great for outdoor adventures and fieldwork. Get yours today by becoming a [Public Lab Sustaining Member ](https://secure.lglforms.com/form_engine/s/pbXczj9cZ9B72z41PIFYgw)at the $50 level.
