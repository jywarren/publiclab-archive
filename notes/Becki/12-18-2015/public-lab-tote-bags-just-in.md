# Public Lab Tote Bags just in!

Look what arrived at the Portland office just in time for our end of year giving campaign -- these awesome Public Lab totebags! With artwork designed by our very own Jeff Warren and printed by our friends Loric and Breezy at [EvolTwin](http://www.evoltwin.com/Evoltwin_printing/Stores/AboutUs) printshop right here in Portland.

These bags are **[available here](https://secure.lglforms.com/form_engine/s/pbXczj9cZ9B72z41PIFYgw)** at the $30 Sustaining Member level -- a great deal, if I do say so myself. Get one for yourself or you favorite Public Labber today and help us reach our end of year goal of raising $5000 by December 31.
