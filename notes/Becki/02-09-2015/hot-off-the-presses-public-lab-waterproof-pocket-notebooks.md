# Hot off the presses--Public Lab waterproof pocket notebooks!

Thanks to our friends at Eberhardt Press, our waterproof notebooks are in the mail today to all the Neural Net contributors in our Public Lab Sustaining Members program! These handy little notebooks are 100% made in the USA and 100% recyclable, and are a great place to keep notes while you're out in the field. Get yours by becoming a [Sustaining Member](https://secure.lglforms.com/form_engine/s/pbXczj9cZ9B72z41PIFYgw) today!
