# Cannot find colour spectrum

Hello,
Yesterday I built a spectrometer using the guides on this website. It worked perfectly. I was able to see a spectrum and take a reading.  Nothing has changed with the spectrometer, but now I cannot find a spectrum anywhere. No matter where I position the webcam, I cannot see a spectrum. Is this something anyone else has experienced? I've attached a photo of when it was working yesterday.

Thanks,
Spencer
