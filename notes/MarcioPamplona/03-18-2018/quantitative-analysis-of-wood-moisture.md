# Quantitative analysis of wood moisture

I need some advice on how to design a system to measure the amount of moisture in wood.   
Measurement by reflection, directly on the surface of the material.  
Do you have to calibrate for each type of material or can we directly measure the amount of water molecules in the material?  
  
Thanks in advance
