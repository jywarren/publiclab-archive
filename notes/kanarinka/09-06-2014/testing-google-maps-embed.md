# Testing Google Maps Embed

###What I want to do
@donblair and I are going to be making a collaborative map of water conductivity with my journalism students and I want to see if we can embed a collaborative Google Map on the PublicLab site.

###My attempt and results
Looks like I can:

###Questions and next steps
Is there a collaborative map making tool that is open source and allows for embedding multimedia content in markers?

###Why I'm interested
I'm teaching a journalism class about data visualization and we are doing an experimental module on sensor journalism. Students will be building the "Coqu√≠" kit and collecting conductivity measurements around Boston.
