# SPN-VEG - NDVI software for windows freeware

Hi,

I'm a researcher and developer of software in Portugal. Here, I present the SPN-VEG software, is image processing software to calculate e analyse NDVI images captured by changed photograh cameras, like as publiclab contributors uses.  

This software are in constant development, so, all cotntributions are welcome. At the moment only works at OS Windows 64 bits. I'm working at new version to work at more OS systems.

In attachment I show my webpage, where you can request the software: http://samuellago7.wix.com/spneg or you can send an email to spn.engeo@gmail.com
At this moment the webpage are in Portuguese, but I'm working to add English version and others languages. 

I hope this software help you. Any kind of coments are welcome to improve the software.

Best regards,
Samuel Neves
