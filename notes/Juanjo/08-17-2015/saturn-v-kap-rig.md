# Saturn V KAP rig

Build a Saturn V rig for KAP

Hello
Recently I got my Saturn V Rig.
The rig comes as shown in the picture, after 3 Hour the rig was ready. I should say thet I received the soldering done and a camera to fit in it so I didn´t have the make the hole to fit the camera.
As I didnt have and drill around I made the holes to asemple the lower part of the rig with a knife.
I couldn´t find the plastic circle to place between the lines of the Picavet suspension so I cut a slice of a water hose to replace it

The rig seems to work very well, and the CHDK coordinates the camera perfectly with the rig pan and tilt movements.
I am waiting for a bit of wind to test it on the skyes,
