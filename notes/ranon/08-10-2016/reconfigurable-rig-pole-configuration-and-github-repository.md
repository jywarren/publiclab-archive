# Reconfigurable Rig Pole Configuration and GitHub Repository

#Pole Configuration

The most recent configuration for the Reconfigurable Rig is the portrait pole configuration. It utilizes components found in the Reconfigurable Rig kit, including 1/4" wooden dowels and nylon cable clamps.

#Pole Testing

Yesterday, @mathew and I had the chance to take the rig out into the field and try it out.

###Pole Panorama Method

While testing the rig, @mathew developed a method for keeping the pole steady while rotating the camera for a panorama. By resting the pole on the toes of your shoes and using that foot as a pivot point, it is easy to give the pole a consistent turn without causing too much movement.

#Reconfigurable Rig GitHub Repository

The Reconfigurable Rig project, including files for CAD and assembly instructions is now live as a GitHub repository, located [here](https://github.com/ranon96/Reconfigurable-Rig). All files are currently up to date including the pole rig configuration. 

###What would you like to improve?

Are there any other configurations or improvements you'd like to make to the Reconfigurable Rig? I'd encourage those with interest in the Reconfigurable Rig project to create their own versions in the GitHub repository!
