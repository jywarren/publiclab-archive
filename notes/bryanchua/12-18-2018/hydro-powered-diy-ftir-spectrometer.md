# Hydro-powered DIY FTIR Spectrometer

Hi,

My friends and I came up with this idea in a makerspace class. Does anyone know if such an idea would work and what materials would be needed? The end goal is to make something that could detect for chemical pollutants like mercury and microbiological contaminants like E. coli. It would be deployed in rural areas with little or no WiFi or cellular networks and the LoRaWAN chip will transmit water quality data reliably and anonymously so people on the ground would not be persecuted by illegal gold mining or drug syndicates who pollute their water. The hydro-powered motor powers the floating device and recharges the battery to power the Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy module that will periodically measure the water.
