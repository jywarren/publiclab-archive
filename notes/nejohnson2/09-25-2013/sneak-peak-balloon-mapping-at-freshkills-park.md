# Sneak Peak Balloon Mapping at Freshkills Park

##What I want to do:
Sneak Peak is an annual event hosted by the Parks Department and New York Department of Sanitation held at Freshkills Park in Staten Island.  The event is an opportunity for the public to explore Freshkills Park through biking, hiking, canoeing and other outdoor activities.  This year there will be a new event, balloon mapping!

In partnership with Public Labs, the New York City Parks Department, Open Trash Lab and the Center for Urban Science and Progress, we will be hosting three workshops during the event to demonstrate balloon photography techniques and let the public begin to map this vast landscape.

The event will be held on Sunday, September 29th from 11am to 4pm in Freshkills Park Staten Island. For more information about the event, visit the [Official Site](http://www.nycgovparks.org/highlights/festivals/freshkills-sneak-peak).
