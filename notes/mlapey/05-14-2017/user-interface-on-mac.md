# User Interface on Mac

I've been having issues toggling between modes using a mac. In the tutorial, it says that I can easily click a photo and an option bar will come up. This has not been the case for me. I've found that I can use keyboard shortcuts to toggle between modes (e.g. between distortion and rotation) but cannot use the option bar as advertised. Any advice?
