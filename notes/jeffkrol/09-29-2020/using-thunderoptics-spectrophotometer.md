# Using Thunderoptics spectrophotometer

Hi I was wondering if anyone used Thunderoptics "camera" to capture a spectrum?

Windows 10 sees it properly and can work with it just fine.

Your software identifies the camera but shows a blank screen.

Using Firefox 81.0 64bit.

any suggestions?![image description](/i/41017.jpg "thunder1.JPG")
