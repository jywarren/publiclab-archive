# Test of the Thermal Light: Env+Tech_NEU2014

###What I want to do
Create a thermal flash light with a broad diffused light. 

###My attempt and results
It was very difficult to make the light reflect on the objects that we were taking pictures of. It may be because the sensor was blocked when we tried to diffuse the light or light was block by the container that we constructed for the Arduino. 

###Questions and next steps
It would be great to make some kind of extention for the sensor and possibly a lens of some sort for the light diffusion.

###Why I'm interested
To understand temperatures in new and interesting ways that can enable new environmental project.
The thermal flashlight is potentially a way to detect if you house is leaking heat.
