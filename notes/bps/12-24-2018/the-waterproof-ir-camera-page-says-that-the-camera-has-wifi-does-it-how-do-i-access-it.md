# The waterproof IR camera page says that the camera has WiFi. Does it? How do I access it?

I just purchased a wp200 camera from the store. It says that the camera has wifi but from what I an see from other websites, it does not. Has this been modified in some way? Is this camera able to take IR picture by itself or must I use some software to process the images? If so, which software?
