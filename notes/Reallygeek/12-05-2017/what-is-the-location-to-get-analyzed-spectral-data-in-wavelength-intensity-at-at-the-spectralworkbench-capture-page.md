# What is the location to get analyzed spectral data in [wavelength, intensity] at at the SpectralWorkbench/capture page?

I've never really used API's before, so forgive me if my terminology's wrong.

I'm looking to get real time data of the intensity of wavelengths for a robotics program.

Thank you.
