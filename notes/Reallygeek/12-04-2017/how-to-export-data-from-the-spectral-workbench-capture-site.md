#  how to export data from the spectral workbench capture site?

I'm try to get real time data of \[wavelength, intensity\] from the "https://spectralworkbench.org/capture" page. I want to export that data and import it to an arduino script for a robotics project. 

  
Does anyone know where that data of \[wavelength, intensity\] gets stored/ what's the variable name?

  
Another idea I had is creating the data as a CVS file and exporting that. Does anyone know anything about that?
