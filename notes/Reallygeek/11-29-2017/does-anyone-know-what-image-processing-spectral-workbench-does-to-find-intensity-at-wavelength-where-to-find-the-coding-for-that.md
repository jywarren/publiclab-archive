# Does anyone know what image processing spectral workbench does to find intensity at wavelength/ where to find the coding for that?

I have the github file downloaded and got all that code on a javascript editing program. I'm hoping to take a cvs file and export that into an arduino so I can make a close-looping fluid monitoring system. Anyone familiar with the spectral workbench code?
