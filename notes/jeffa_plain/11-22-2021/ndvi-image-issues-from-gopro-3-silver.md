NDVI with Red Filter  
  
Hello, I'm very new to NDVI stuff and I've recently created an infragram camera from a Gopro 3 using the public lab guide and color filters. Everything seems to work as intended (except for photos being a little over-exposed) however when I feed the images into infragram.org, the NDVI spectrum is inverted, (plants are blue while non-photosynthetic material is green through red). When I try and use the opposing preset on these images, the result is just a solid color. is there a way I can get the -1 to 0 and the 0 to 1 color map to be flipped on infragram.org?  
  
Thank you
