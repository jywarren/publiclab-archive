# Question: "live" compare to camera feed

Does the current version of the spectralworkbench allow comparison to the "live" camera feed?  I click on "compare" from the live feed, but when I select a previously acquired spectra, it doesn't overlay the spectra with the live image.  

My software interface looks very different from those on the tutorial videos.
