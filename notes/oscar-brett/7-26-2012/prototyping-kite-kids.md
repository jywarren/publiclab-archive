# Prototyping a kite for kids

Here at Beam Camp in New Hampshire Kids like to make things happen; As a staffer, I like to help kids make things happen. This past week a group of us counselors worked to develop a (lesson) plan for teaching kids how to build their own kites. Using only discarded balsa wood slats, mylar (from an emergency blanket), duct tape, string, and hot glue.

As of now kite is non functional; however, we will continue to post as project develops.
