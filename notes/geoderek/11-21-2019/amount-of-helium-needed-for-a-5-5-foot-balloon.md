# Amount of helium needed for a 5.5 foot balloon

Hello, 

I am hoping someone with balloon mapping experience can answer my question or direct me to a resource to identify the correct size tank need for 1 flight. Of course, I will want to have more than one flight, but I am trying to get the minimum specs down for now. 

  
I ordered and received a 5.5 foot (170cm) reusable\* balloon made of a latex/chloroprene (neoprene) mix which is a part of the Balloon Mapping Kit. Would 14.9 cubic feet of helium tank that is 80% helium, 20% air blend work for filling this up at least one time?   

  
Thanks, 

Derek
