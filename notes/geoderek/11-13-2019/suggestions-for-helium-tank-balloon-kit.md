# Suggestions for helium tank Balloon kit

Hello, I was wondering where folks buy their helium tanks for a Balloon mapping kit? Also, do most buy or rent them because I imagine after you use them you are left with this empty tank that you really don't need sitting around? When leads to a third question about whether you would then go to refill them?

  
Thanks for any experience information you can provide.
