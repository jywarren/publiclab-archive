# How to convert the csv or xml files to spectrum graph? 

###What I want to do or know
I want to know if and how I can use the downloaded spectral file (e.g. csv or xml) to create a spectral distribution graph like the one spectrometers show.

Also is there anyway (and whether it is allowed) to download/compile an executable (.exe) file that runs public lab spectrometer like a portable file with ability to calibrate?

Thanks!
