# AWB_Gains for PiNoIRCamera V2 (Red Filter)

Hello, currently i'm working on a platform,  already introduced in [this question . ](https://publiclab.org/questions/kauemv2/05-16-2019/should-i-use-two-sheets-of-filter#answer-comment-24181 "https://publiclab.org/questions/kauemv2/05-16-2019/should-i-use-two-sheets-of-filter#answer-comment-24181")

  
As I stated there, i'm working with a PiNoIRCamera V2, to study the heatlth of urban vegetation. And as @cfastie told, i will need to set a custom white balance, in order to make image more sensible to the blue band...

  
So anyone knows optimum values for the awb\_gains settings for the Pi Camera?
