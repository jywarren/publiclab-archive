Join us in New Orleans to learn about Classroom Community Science Programming!

This three-day workshop brings together high school educators from across the Gulf Coast to learn about implementing community science methodologies in the classroom. The focus of the summer workshop is to introduce educators to community science as well as to support the use of Public Lab tools and connections to the Public Lab community in classrooms.

This workshop will introduce educators to a series of lessons designed to engage students in hands-on, locally-situated environmental science projects as they explore challenges facing their community using open hardware and community science principles. In this process, students engage in community citizen science via Public Lab methodologies. Students lead the research project with support from their teacher rather than being led through a predetermined rubric. As a team, students undertake problem identification, study design, data collection and analysis, and sharing results back to their community. [You can learn more about the lesson plans and see examples of student work here.](https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=008366342703784425914:_p25pf-gy_w&q=https://publiclab.org/wiki/student-led-community-science-in-the-classroom-a-curriculum&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj5-uyCv_nmAhXKG80KHYChCgQQFjAAegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw2Kr2j5mmvaLvYUI8NnL0JK)

Participants will receive a stipend of $250 upon successful completion of the workshop. Participants will also receive an Infragram Pi Camera, which we will build together during our workshop.
