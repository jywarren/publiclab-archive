# What light sources might I use to calibrate my spectrometer if I don’t have a CFL available?

I'm interested in working with the LEGO spectrometer but I don't have a CFL at this time. Short of ordering one, what are some other ways that I could get started?

This figure from an unrelated paper has some details on the emission spectra of different light sources: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Emission-spectra-of-different-light-sources-a-incandescent-tungsten-light-bulb-b_fig1_312320039
