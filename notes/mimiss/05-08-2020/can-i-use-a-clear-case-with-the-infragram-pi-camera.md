# Can I use a clear case with the Infragram pi camera?

I  want to build an Infragram Pi Camera. I have found a raspberry pi case that is clear, and I w ant to  build my  camera in this. 

Will the red filter over the lens be enough to keep unfiltered light out? Are there any extra steps I should take, like a more tight seal between filter and  lens/case?
