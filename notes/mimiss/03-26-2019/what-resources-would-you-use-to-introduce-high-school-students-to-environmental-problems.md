# What are some of your favorite community science projects from around the world?

I'm looking for materials to help introduce students to environmental science through exploring environmental issues. I'd love to share with them articles or blog posts on a person or community's experience with an event that changed the local landscape, such as a wildfire, flood, or pollution issue. Have you read something recently that resonated with you?
