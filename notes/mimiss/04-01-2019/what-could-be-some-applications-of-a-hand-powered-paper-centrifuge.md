# What could be some applications of a hand-powered paper centrifuge?

I've been looking at this paper centrifuge designed for use in healthcare: https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/low-cost-hand-powered-paper-centrifuge

  
I'm thinking that something similar could open up new opportunities with our existing kits. Could it be used to separate components of a water sample for spectrometry or microscopy? What kind of force and control would be needed to achieve sample separation? Could a filter be included in the spin column to separate micro plastics by size?
