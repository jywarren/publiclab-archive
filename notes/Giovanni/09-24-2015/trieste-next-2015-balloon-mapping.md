# Trieste Next 2015 - Balloon Mapping

In Trieste (Northeast of Italy) this weekend (2015, 24-26 september) there is a scientific manifestation named Trieste Next (http://triestenext.veneziepost.it/).

We partecipate with  a conference about Balloon Mapping the activities carried out last year (2014): we discuss about the evolution of balloon activities (also comparing with UAV technologies) and we present our main results regarding how the people move into the square.
