# adjustable camera mount

Very simple. A piece of aluminum is drilled through and recessed on one side to provide a flat camera mounting surface when the screw is inserted, or it can be threaded and a piece of threaded stock used instead, with the threads mangled to keep them from turning. the camera is mounted, the assembly inserted into the case, and the washer and nut installed. a slot cut in the end of the screw is used for adjustment with the nut loosened slightly, then the nut is tightened to lock the setting down.

A piece of stiff wire can be placed in the slot to serve as both angle indicator and handle, and angles can be drawn on the box or a fancy scale printed and applied.

The adjustment is quite dramatic at 200u. I have not checked at 400 yet. In the latter case even if it makes little difference in the quality of the readings, it might be used to manually calibrate the unit to a known peak, enabling use with much simpler software in standalone situations where it can be calibrated well enough. It also provides the capability to center the spectrum on the array.
