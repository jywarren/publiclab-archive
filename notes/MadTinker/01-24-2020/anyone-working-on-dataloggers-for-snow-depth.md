# anyone working on dataloggers for snow depth?

There are a number of technologies available for measuring snow depth. I'm currently using a snow board (sorta like a bricklayer cement hod). There are various snow pillow technologies (pressure sensors under perforated plates) and also a sensor from Campbell that measures (I think) the distance from the ground to the top of the snow via a change in the electrostatic charge (?). I live in the SW Rockies and snowpack is a critical environmental metric. FWIW - my last project was wiped out by unexpected, very extreme snowpack. Anyone with sensor ideas that I could incorporate into a data logger?  \[I think a sonar approach would be pretty cool... but no experience in that area.\] Thoughts or ideas?  Dave
