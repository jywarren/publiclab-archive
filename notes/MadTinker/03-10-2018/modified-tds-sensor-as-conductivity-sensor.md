# Modified TDS sensor as Conductivity Sensor? 

(Cheap) conductivity sensors are difficult to find and there's considerable number of references in Public Lab and, for example, [Ed Mallon in his Cave Pearl Project Blog](https://thecavepearlproject.org/2017/08/12/measuring-electrical-conductivity-with-an-arduino-part1-overview/) (excellent!). I'm still struggling with finding a good, solid basic circuit and have some Coqui-ish thing that I'm working on now.  However, I was wondering if there is any reason why a TDS monitor ( e.g. the [one by DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1662.html))  couldn't be modified to collect EC data? Obviously the DFRobot TDS monitor could be temperature compensated, the input scaled appropriately, and the probe would still have the over-voltage/hydrogen problem, but it seems that at $13 it's not a bad option.  

  
What am I missing?
