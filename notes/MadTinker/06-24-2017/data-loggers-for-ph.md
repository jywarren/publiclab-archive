# data loggers for PH ? 

I'm looking for data loggers where a PH sensor is an option.  

I'm just starting out and, being a naturally lazy sod, was hoping someone could nudge me toward the data loggers where PH measurements might be available.  

I've been lurking on/off for a bit, but had small push to get serious.  My interest is in monitoring mine tailings in the Rocky Mountain region.  My wife and I were recently offered the 'opportunity' to rebuild the habitat (vegetation, etc.) in a portion of a reclamation area (2-3 acres). I'd like to monitor the water quality of the creek that flows through our oxbow section. PH seems to be the easiest thing to start with.  (right?). Obviously, I'd like to measure heavy metals, but that's a bit far off.  

FWIW - the mountain creek would be considered a small river back east.   

Any pointers would be appreciated.  

Cheers,
Dave Robinson
