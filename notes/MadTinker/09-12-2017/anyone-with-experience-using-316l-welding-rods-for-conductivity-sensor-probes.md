# Anyone with experience using 316L welding rods for conductivity sensor probes?

316L marine grade stainless steel welding rods seem to have all the right characteristics for conductivity sensor probes, including the fact that I have some sitting here in the corner.  The price is about $14 for a tube of 1/8" x 36" rods. I think there were originally 10 rods in the tube (not sure though).
