# Question:  How to I convert the spectrum from the webcam to a spectral power density graph.

###What I want to do or know
I am a final year electrical engineering student with a project on characterizing an LED light. I need to build a spectrometer, and use the data in another application. 

I would like to know how to convert the image from the camera to the wavelength vs power graph.
