# stablish a communication between Spectral Workbench and an arduino???

###What I want to do or know
Hello,
I was just wondering if anybody has attempted to establish a communication between online Spectral Workbench and an arduino before?

I was looking to extract cvs file of the spectral plots and then feed it to my arduino for the comparison/data analysis. I was wondering if you have any experience with this? 

thanks in advance
