# Desktop Spectrometry Kit to arduino?

###What I want to do or know
hi, 
has anyone tried to connect Desktop Spectrometer to arduino? is there any online documentation on how to do that? and how to feed data to the arduino for further data processing and analyzing? 
I want to scan different objects and compare the spectral patterns using arduino.
thanks
