# GSOC 2020 Week 6 (coding Period Week-2)@Spam Management Dashboard

Hey Everyone :wave: Hope you all are fine :heart: This is my update for last week

- Last week I worked on Digest for unmoderated posts and wrote a test for it([https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7987](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7987 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7987")). There were few errors in stable, I checked its build logs ad made some changes which are in PR([https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7987](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7987 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7987")). I noticed that /spam also has few issues in stable which were mentioned in [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8037](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8037 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8037"). I worked on System test for /spam2 and made a PR for this at [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8038](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8038 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8038").
- Next week I am planning to work on some more filters in all the tables and check dashboard in the stable which is having some issues for /spam2\. Next week I will also write a detailed blog for /spam2\.
- Current blockers: I have mentioned those in [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8037](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8037), Please review and give suggestion

Thanks!!
