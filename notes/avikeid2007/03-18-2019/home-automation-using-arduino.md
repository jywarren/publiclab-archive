â€‹Home automation makes you able to control electronic appliances (turning them on or off )  in your home from a remote control or any portable device. There are several ways to achieve Home Automation. Here, This project is a very simplistic application of Home automation for learning use only.  Arduino Uno and relay control to turning light off or on by remote control.![image description](/i/30250.jpg "IMG_3859.JPG")

**Project required components** :
