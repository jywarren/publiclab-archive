# How can I get the menu to calibrate SpectralWorkbench?

I would like to use SpectralWorkbench in a workshop for students. At Public Lab I'm logged in with a google account. When I start SpectralWorkbench, there is no menu or button for calibration.   
**How can I start the calibration menu?**

Thanks a lot!
