# What is the working principle of Blue/Red filter

[https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram#Filters](https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram#Filters)

I got some basic knowledge about the blue/red filter on the above link.

I am confusing how a
piece of red glass paper (red filter) can block the blue light, so that the
blue channel can use for capture NIR? The red filter would not affect the
green channel? If yes, what is the impact? 

â€¨

As I am trying to
calculate the ENDVI , so I need to know how the filter affecting green
channel. The equation from calculating the ENDVI shown as below: 

ENDVI = \[(NIR + Green) --
(2 \* Blue)\] / \[(NIR + Green) + (2 \* Blue)\]
