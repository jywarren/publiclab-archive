# Looking for recommendations of how to obtain air quality samples around a fracked gas compressor station

1\. A community coalition in New Jersey is concerned about the expansion of a fracked gas compressor station and is seeking air quality samples before an upcoming hearing. 

2\. Finances are limited and the timeframe is short. The sooner samples can be obtained the better. Any advice welcome! 

3\. Many health professionals are involved/concerned as this station impacts drinking water reservoirs and air quality. There are people involved that are willing to be trained who have science backgrounds.
