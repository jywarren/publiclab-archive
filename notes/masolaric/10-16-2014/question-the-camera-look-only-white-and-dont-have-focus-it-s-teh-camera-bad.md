# Question: the camera look only white and dont have focus...it´s teh camera bad?

###I I dont know why dont work the camera? and why I dont can see the spectrum of the light?

###

I buy a Desktop Spectrometry Kit. I follow the assembly instrucction  , but when I conect to the PC the small HD webcam ever show me a white color. 

I test the camera alone and dont show me a clear focused image..... ¿the camera will be bad?
