# Does anyone know the upper spectrum range of the Pi NoIR Camera V2?

I am looking into different cameras or sensors that i can use to measure the following ranges that are useful to agriculture:

  
Cellulose Absorption Index: 2000-2200nm

Plant Water Index: 902-970nm

Disease Water Stress Index: 547-1657nm

NDVI 670-800nm

  
I am also looking for filters or filter combinations for the following ranges:

Cellulose Absorption Index: 2000-2200nm

Plant Water Index: 902-970nm

Disease Water Stress Index: 547-1657nm

  
Thanks All!
