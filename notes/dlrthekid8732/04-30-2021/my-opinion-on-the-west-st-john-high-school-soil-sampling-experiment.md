# My opinion on the West St. John High School Soil Sampling experiment 

During the soil sampling experiment, I learned that our soil might have mercury or might not have mercury in our soil. I also learned that if we don't have enough organic matter in our soil, then our environment might not be protected. My personal opinion about our soil in our environment is that they do have enough organic matter and they have mercury in our soil. I think that this experiment was not hard but it did take along time to finish the test. The reason we did this experiment is to find out what we have in our soil. The thing we were mostly looking for in our soil is mercury. While doing this experiment, I have only done 3 or 4 mistakes during this experiment. In conclusion, I think that this experiment was very informational and fun.
