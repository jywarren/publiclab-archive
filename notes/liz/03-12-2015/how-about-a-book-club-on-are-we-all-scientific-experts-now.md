# How about a book club on "Are we all scientific experts now?"

I picked up this great book by Harry Collins last fall after the 2015 Barnraising. It was recommended to me by @philipsilva after the lively conversation on the role of expertise in community science. The anecdotes are easy to read and make otherwise opaque charts like this suddenly jump out in a very relevant way to Public Lab:

I've discussed this book a bit with @donblair , and would be interested to hear if anyone else has picked up this book or anything else by Harry Collins before.
