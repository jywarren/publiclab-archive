# Five Borough Farm visits Clay Avenue Garden in the Bronx

I visited Clay Avenue Garden at the end of a long day walking miles through the Bronx.  By this time both of my cameras (visible and Infragram) were acting finicky and shutting off at the slightest whim -- they had had a long day too. These wonderful people convinced me to join their BBQ :)
