# How can i manipulate kombucha leather?

_lead image by http://www.instructables.com/id/Kombucha-Fabric/_
I have a sheet of dried kombucha leather. It's slightly flexible, but not very. 
Has anyone tried any manipulations like:

* mold it around a form
* press it into a form
* fold
* cut 
* glue
* sew
* add grommets

or anything else? thanks!
