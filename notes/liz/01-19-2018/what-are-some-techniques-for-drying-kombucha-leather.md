# What are some techniques for drying kombucha leather?

_lead image from http://fashionfuturebyanika.blogspot.com/2011/03/designer-profile-suzanne-lee.html_

My kombucha did grow a thickened layer, and now i want to dry it. What are some techniques for this?
I have some different ideas in mind, such as pressing a texture into it, and keeping it from shrinking into a smaller surface area. Any advice is appreciated!
