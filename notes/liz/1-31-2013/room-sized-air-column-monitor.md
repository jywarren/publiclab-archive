# Room-sized "air column monitor"

<a href="http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/wea01433.htm"</a>

A sophisticated chemistry laboratory, packed into a room-sized container, travels up and down the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) to sample the atmosphere from the ground up to nearly 1,000 feet.
