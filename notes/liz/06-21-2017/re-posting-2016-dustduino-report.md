# Re-posting 2016 Dustduino report

Re-posting from the sensor journalism list: excerpt of @Willie Shubert's message from March 24, 2016: 

Last Friday, we put out a project history of the DustDuino pilot work in Sao Paulo. This report is designed to be a provide an honest appraisal of the work for the purpose of sharing our learning from the last 18 months. Its a bit long (there is a short video as well) but I'd love some feedback on the ideas presented.
