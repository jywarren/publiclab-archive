# Distributed web + Data Together meetup today 4pm in NYC

Here's a just-in-time invite for anyone to stop by the New Lab at 4pm today and hang out with folks from the **Data Together** group that grew out of the "rescue climate data" work from earlier this year. 

Considering yesterday's loss of Net Neutrality regulation in the US, why not spend an hour or two with other Public Labbers who care about data justice and an open internet! We'll also be talking about [nycmesh.net/][1] -- a real option to connect through community mesh straight to lower manhattan's DE-CIX internet exchange *without ever needing anything from Spectrum, Time Warner, Verizon, or Comcast ever again.* 

**How to find us:** 
http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=40.69859&mlon=-73.97455#map=18/40.69859/-73.97455&layers=N

****You must RSVP that you are coming, so we can make you a badge to get in.**
