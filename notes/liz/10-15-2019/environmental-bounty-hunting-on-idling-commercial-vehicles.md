# Environmental bounty hunting on idling commercial vehicles

"Thanks to a new law, any New Yorker with a cell phone and some time to kill can report on idling commercial vehicles, and earn thousands of dollars doing it."

Law 717A (also referred to as Local Law 058 of 2018) allows citizens to present evidence of trucks and buses and limosines idling for over 3 minutes to the Department of Environmental Protection, and earn 25% of a $350 fine. When a vehicle is found idling adjacent to any public or non-public school (pre-Kâ€“12), then the idling limit is no longer than one (1) minute.
