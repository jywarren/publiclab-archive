# Make Open Space signs for an event like the Barnraising

_lead image from the 2015 Barnraising of the Open Space Technology signs that the group wrote in a variety of languages including Spanish, Chinese, Turkish, Korean, and English_

### Background -- why are we making signs?

The facilitation style of [Barnraising](/barnraising) is based in large part on [open space technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology), a way for a group to self-organize a meeting. Read more here: http://www.openspaceworld.com/users_guide.htm

### Signs

* Get colorful, wide markers
* Get chart paper or rolls of paper
* Write as big as possible, with letters at least 3" tall. 
* Aim to fill about 2"x3" or an entire piece of chart paper with each of the six signs. 

Edited for clarity and inclusiveness: 

- Whoever comes are the right people
- Whatever happens is the only thing that could have 
- Whenever it starts is the right time
- When it is over, it is over
- The Law of Mobility
- Be Prepared to Be Surprised
