# brainstorming the significance of air quality

8th grade student brainstorming on air quality. Various groups took on the questions "Who" "What" "Where" "When" and "Why". There was also some brainstorming on how to lean more about how other people who aren't in this class view air quality, and students wrote down questions to ask in a future survey to their peers, neighbors, and family members.
