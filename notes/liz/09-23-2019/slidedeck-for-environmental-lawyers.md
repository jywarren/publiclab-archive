# Slidedeck for environmental lawyers

Here is a basic Public Lab deck with messaging tuned towards presenting to environmental lawyers. 

To make it cute, i created a couple of Award Categories for community-collected data, which gave me the excuse to use "trophy" emojis:

Next steps: 

* Please re-use this deck to engage more environmental lawyers in our community!
* I'm interested in feedback to make this better and more comprehensive, so please comment!
