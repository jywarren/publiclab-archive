# Haze over chilly Manhattan

Is this haze from heavy oils being burned, like the infamous Heating Oil #6? 

* "New Yorkers burn more than 1 billion gallons of heating oil every year which accounts for nearly 14% of fine particulate matter pollutants emitted into our air; more PM2.5 emissions than all cars and trucks in the city combined." - from http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/air/buildings_heating_oil.shtml
