# map of Green Garden June 27 2014

**https://mapknitter.org/map/view/2014-07-27-new-jersey-newark-green-garden-visible**

##map details

These images were taken by a Canon S100 on top of a 50' pole that was extended to about 45'. Lots of lens distortion due to low height of image capture; additional visual interference from a tall green house structure which exaggerated the angle that the photo was taken from. During map knitting, ground accuracy of garden beds was prioritized, with secondary aesthetic consideration given to aligning the greenhouse members. 

###points of interest

Carla and Liz can be spotted weeding in the garden, while two passers-by stare up from the sidewalk.
