# Staten Island North Shore meets with GLAM

This morning Beryl Thurman (North Shore Waterfront Conservancy) and Melissa Checker (CUNY) met with Eymund Diegel, Lise Brenner and I to discuss concerns about floodwater carrying pollution from former industrial and radioactive sites into adjacent neighborhoods. These types of concerns are shared amongst Gowanus and North Shore residents who live adjacent to industrial areas built on filled-in historic wetlands. 

We discussed how we could develop a community research project. **Follow along with our process on http://publiclab.org/wiki/staten-island**

##Looking ahead

* May: information gathering, see http://publiclab.org/wiki/staten-island#Other+data+sources:
* late June or July kite mapping of the northshore from a boat, possibly NY/NJ Baykeeper
