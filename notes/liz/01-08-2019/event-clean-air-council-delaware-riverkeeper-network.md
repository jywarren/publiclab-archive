Resident quote: 
>*I think that the residents in Philadelphia should know that air quality in Center City is usually much better than in our rural area. I also think that the city residents should know that the concentrations of various wastes and including the Philadelphia bio solids are washing right back into the Perkiomen Creek and then the Green Lane Reservoir which supplies much of the drinking water. The contaminated creek also supplies much of the cooling water for the Limerick Nuclear Power Plant and all the wastes come back into the environment out of the towers.*
