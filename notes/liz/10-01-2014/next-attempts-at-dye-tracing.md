# next attempts at dye tracing

###What I want to do

**September 27, 2014**

This note documents Eymund's dye tracing experiments at two sites. 

###Site 1: new wetlands on edge of the salt lot

Eymund showing that the dye--as proxy for sediment--reveals that constructed wetlands should not exceed 6' from the edge of the bulkhead/bank:

###Site 2: hypothesized Vechtes Brook flowing into Gowanus through landfilled 5th Street Basin

@bronwen pouring in a gallon of red dye:

Studying flow patterns:

###Results

FROM ABOVE: 
The dye goes in:

The dye is clearly visible from the balloon, which is important for future attempts, but it seems like the path of the canoe disturbs the path of the dye.

###Next steps

We will repeat this experiment with a two tethered balloon held by canoers, **but** with the dye released by someone standing under the bridge where the inflow can be clearly observed. 

###Why I'm interested

The discovery of flowing groundwater at the 1st street basin is altering both federal EPA and municipal DEP restoration and management plans. We want to continue research along these lines.
