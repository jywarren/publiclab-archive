# Can collecting dust on a sticky pad result in EPA review?

I am asking a question on behalf of a community member. They want to know: 

1) would collecting dust on a sticky pad, described [here][1] by @mathew and in the activity linked in the comments, could get the Federal EPA to come in where their State DEP has refused to collect data? For context, i can share that the State DEP has refused to do air quality monitoring about agriculture related issues because agricultural activities are not regulated by their agency. 

2) If the community did an exercise to collect dust in their neighborhoods and inside their homes, would this be informative to the people in the area about the particulate matter air quality issues they may have?
