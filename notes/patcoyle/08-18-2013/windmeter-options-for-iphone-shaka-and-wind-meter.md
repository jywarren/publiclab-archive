# Windmeter options for iPhone - Shaka and Wind Meter

Windmeters can be helpful in refining our intuition when considering flying kites, balloons or UAVs.

I recently got the [Shaka hardware/app combo](http://shakaon.net/) (~$70) and have had the [Wind Meter app ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wind-meter/id306375551?mt=8) ($0.99) for the iPhone for a while. Shaka also captures temperature and wind direction and records the location in a history list.

While, I've not compared them head-to-head, I wanted to invite discussion on other options and how people are using windspeed indicators.
