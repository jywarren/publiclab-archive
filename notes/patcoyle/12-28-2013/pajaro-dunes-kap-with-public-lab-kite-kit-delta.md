# Pajaro Dunes KAP with Public Lab Kite kit Delta

###What I want to do

Continue flying Public Lab Kite kit Delta. Image below shows SX260HS in juice bottle rig with two-point attachment to kite line with looped line, S-biners and Brooks hangups.

###My attempt and results

Videos shows Gomberg's 9' (274 cm) Dazzle Delta flies well, but wind conditions were too light to lift dual cameras. Did better with single SX260HS camera. However in light wind, flight was low altitude.
