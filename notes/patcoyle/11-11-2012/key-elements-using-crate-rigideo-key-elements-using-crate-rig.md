# Key elements of using the crate rig

In this ~ three-minute video from Barnraising 2012, Mathew Lippincott and Jessi Breen illustrate key elements of using the crate rig. The video addresses use of the small crates, flexible Picavet rigging, so the crate can be oriented for straight-down or oblique camera shooting, Picavet line management to avoid tangling, and a clever rubber band tie-off technique for mounting equipment such as cameras, GPS trackers, iPhones, or whatever on the crate.
