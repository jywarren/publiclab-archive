# Preliminary testing of small pocket sled kite for Mobius camera

###What I want to do
Explore smaller kites for use with [Mobius camera](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-point-shoot). At 38 grams for the camera, smaller kites or balloons could be useful. Inspired by [Jeff Warren's smaller balloon discussion](http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-21-2015/mobius-cameras-and-smaller-balloons), I picked up a small pocket sled from Into The Wind's store on Pearl Street, in Boulder.

###My attempt and results
I got the kite launched and attached a large binder clip as a test weight.

The kite is small and a bit skittish as can see in videos below:

###Questions and next steps

Try with camera, explore rigging options, evaluate where the small, no-spar, soft kites make sense.

###Why I'm interested

Small portable mapping options could be handy.
