# Are there any DIY equipment that measure dissolved oxygen levels in water?

I getting into the process monitoring dissolved oxygen levels a part of the O'Bannon Creek, in Loveland, Ohio, that drains into the Little Miami River and I'm wondering if there is any DIY equipment that can be used and if any discussion about those was here.
