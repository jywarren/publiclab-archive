# Environmental Science Climate Change Poster Campaign 

Environmental Science Climate Change Poster Campaign 

Today the STEM Magnet Program of St. John the Baptist Parish School District in Louisiana engaged in a poster campaign to raise awareness on a number of topics involving the environment, climate control, and water conservation, and preservation of ecosystems. The exercise served to allow the scholars to collaborate and synthesize themes that could raise awareness and promote change. The earth we inhabit was designed to facilitate life and function with a plethora of essential resources necessary to sustain human existence. Humans therefore have a responsibility to conserve, protect, cultivate, enhance, and preserve our natural resources of air, earth, and water. The poster campaign to raise awareness is one step in a long process.
