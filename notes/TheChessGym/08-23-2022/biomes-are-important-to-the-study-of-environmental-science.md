# Biomes Are Important to The Study Of Environmental Science

We studied the denoting the definition of a biome. Additionally biomes are composed of both abiotic and biotic components. There are three categories consisting of producers, consumers, and decomposers. Interestingly enough, these categories have subsets of Carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores. Notwithstanding, there are divisions of organisms denoted as predators and prey, both of which are interdependent thriving in the same biome. I am thankful to Public lab's formation and mission to inform the average citizen of the importance of the factors that contribute to the awareness of our changing environment.
