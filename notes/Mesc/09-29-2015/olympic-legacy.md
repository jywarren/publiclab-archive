# Olympic Legacy

Map the bio health of the Olympic Park.

What appears on the maps around the 2012 Olympic site is lots of green.  What I see is building sites and roads.    Would it be possible to see how much land is now designated for private use?  How much is being used as park?  How accessible it is to the local areas or new business centres within the park?
