# Baffle for Spectrometer 3.0

Sometimes, scattered light can degrade the contrast of the spectrum, particularly if you are observing a very bright source. 

To minimize this, I made a papercraft baffle for Spectrometer 3.0. Just print out the attached pdf file. Cut it out, assemble it, then attach it to the bench with the leftover Velcro. 

I think this should be added to the spectrometer kit.
