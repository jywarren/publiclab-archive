# How can real-time camera monitoring be set up?  

###What I want to do or know
[
Fair Tech Collective](https://www.fairtechcollective.org/) folks are investigating options for configuring cameras to monitor oil refineries, in the San Francisco Bay Area.

We're curious about different approaches to real-time camera monitoring, including any documentation of real-time monitoring projects in the Public Lab community?

###Background story

Noticed this earlier post, including a reference to a [real-time video of smokestack monitoring. ](https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/09-16-2016/what-s-the-best-way-to-archive-store-a-timelapse-video)
