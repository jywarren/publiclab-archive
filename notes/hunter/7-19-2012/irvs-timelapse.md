# IR+VS TIMELAPSE

I am working with two PlantCams to find ways into making a sequential (movie) method for NRG imaging.
The cameras are rather quirky though, and are proving to be more a step in the right direction than anything else.
I have yet to be able to leave a camera in the field for multiple days without error. 

I have just switched my workflow from Photoshop+FinalCut to After Effects. It is relieving and managable. So, once I have figured the process well enough, I will make a screencast.

I hope to soon have a dedicated page up here on PLOTS for Timelapse NRG.

For now you can see my tests:
