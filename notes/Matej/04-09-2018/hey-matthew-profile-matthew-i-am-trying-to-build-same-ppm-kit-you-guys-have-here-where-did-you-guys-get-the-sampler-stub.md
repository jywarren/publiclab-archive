# Hey @matthew I am trying to build same PPM kit you guys have here. Where did you guys get the sampler stub?

I understand that it is the electron microscope sampler, but from the photos it looks like there is some sort of mesh on the top to filter larger particles. Does the sampler stub comes with the mesh or attached it additionally? If yes, what's the "resolution" of the mesh?

Warmest,
