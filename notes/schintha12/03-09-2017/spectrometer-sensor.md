# Spectrometer/Sensor

Which sensor/spectrometer can be used to quantify the blood contents through the skin (non invasive)?
I want to compare the level of a protein in healthy and sick individual non-invasively. I was wondering if any kind of spectrometer or sensor can give me a characteristic curve/peak which I can compare without drawing the blood.
