# Balloon Mapping Bayou Plaquemines

This is a map from a 3000 ft high balloon sent up mid day on September 10, 2014.  Beautiful weather, sunny, and barely windy.  A crew of 7 people, 6 of them architecture students at Washington University in St. Louis.  The ballon was in the air for about 45 minutes.
