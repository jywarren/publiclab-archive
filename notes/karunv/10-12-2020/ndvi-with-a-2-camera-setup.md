# NDVI with a 2 camera setup

Hello,

I was exploring detecting stress levels in plants in my backyard and put together a 2 camera system as follow.

Would like to get feedback on whether this setup is right to help me calculate NDVI and in-turn determine growth in my lemon plants

Camera 1: OV5647 IR-Cut camera (so I believe this has no IR filter)

Camera 2: another OV5647 IR-Cut camera with a Mid-opt IR 850nm filter attached externally

I have aligned the pictures of these 2 cameras.

Camera1 Picture:![image description](/i/41125.jpg "Camera1.jpg")

Camera 2 Picture:![image description](/i/41126.jpg "Camera2.jpg")

My questions were:

\#1) Can my camera 1 be a NoIR/IR-cut camera or does it need to be a "regular" camera with an IR filter

\#2) To calculate NDVI, I am currently using the "R" channels of both of these images. Is this correct or should I be using other channels

\#3) More broadly, is detecting "stress" level in individual plants at a close range is my goal, is there a better setup / model towards achieving that.

Thank you
