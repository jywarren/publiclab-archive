# Free Phototrap in Ateneo Atlántico de Prototipado and more

###DIY/DIWO Free Citizen Science Community: the project was started with habitat association and Ateneo Atlántico de Prototipado  (a lab which I was coordinating) science, society and technology laboratory.

### Phototrap camera prototype with rapsberry pi. webview and semantic search of the videos in django/python3. efkin,Habitat, Quiroga and geeksha participation.

###We need to test and optimize the prototypes and add new prototypes adapted to the biological study techniques.

###Because it's so relevant to have a DIY citizen sicence community, divulgate the biodiversity and to be more independent from the traditional knolewdge institutions
