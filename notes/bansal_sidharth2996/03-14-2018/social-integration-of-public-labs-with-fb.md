# Social Integration of Public Labs with FB

I want to have community's opinion regarding Social integration with Facebook.  
Users after logging into Facebook will then be able to  
1) Send invites to other friends to join Public Labs. This will increase the number of users on Public Labs  
2) Users will be notified on the facebook whenever there would be any comment on liked wiki pages, research notes.  
3) Users will be able to write comments and share information through the facebook.  
The login through the Facebook is under development.
