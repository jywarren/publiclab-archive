# PhotosynQ in Detroit 

Hi all, 

I'm interested in using the PhotosynQ device to collect data in Detroit and the metro region for journalism-related stories. A couple of ideas I'm kicking around include using the device to test plant health in different city neighborhoods, and using it to test soil quality in areas being considered for urban farming. 

I'd be interested in any other ideas people may have for PhotosynQ in an urban setting. I work for a news website, so my end goal is to write stories about the health of the environment in Detroit. All data, though, will be shared publicly. 

Thanks much for any feedback and I'll post updates as the project moves forward. 

-Dustin
