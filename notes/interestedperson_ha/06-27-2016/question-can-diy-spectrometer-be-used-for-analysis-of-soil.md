# Question: Can DIY-spectrometer be used for analysis of soil

Dear public lab contributors, fascinated by a simple  cardboard-spectrometer (based on a CD as diffraction-grating) I wonder if it's possible (and affordable) to construct a DIY-spectrometer which can be used for measuring chemical concentrations. In particular it's about analyzing soil for ordinary garden plants with regard to nutritient content.
I would be glad about any clues /hints about  what kind of diffraction-grating, what type camera etc. is needed/sufficient for that.
