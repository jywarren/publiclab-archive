# FieldKit: What features do you want?

# Help us make FieldKit.

FieldKit is an open sensing platform that will dramatically reduce the cost of research-grade environmental sensors, simplify the processes of data management, visualization and sharing, and make environmental sensing accessible to all.

We're trying to learn a bit more about how people might use FieldKit in the real world. Help us by answering a few easy questions (only 3-4 minutes), and we'll give you a special discount when FieldKit is released.
