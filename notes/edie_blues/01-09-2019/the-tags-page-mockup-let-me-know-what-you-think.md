# The Tags page mockup - let me know what you think! 

Hello again,

This is Eva again, your friendly web designer :)

I've started working on the https://publiclab.org/tags page design, which is a little bit tricky.

The current tags page offers a lot of information. I think it's great that the user has a chance to see all the tags used - although the sorting function isn't working great (I can't get the "# of people subscribed" to work, for example).

After thinking about it hard I approached this page design with two goals:

1\. We need to show the users the tags they might be interested in (but they are not following yet)

2\. We need to show the user how to tag correctly

I also threw in a "Random" button to show a random tag and a "Hall of Fame", because those stats are always fun to see.

I think that before we can design a more effective /tags page, the tags will have to be sorted, arranged, perhaps grouped into families so that the "Suggested For Me" functionality will also work better (see the mockup below). I think users might also be more mindful of tagging correctly, once everything is in order.

If the tags were to be sorted, I would replace the current central-block (the table) with a table of contents look, featuring tag families.

Below is a mockup of my progress so far.

As always, please let me know your thoughts! :)

Thanks,

Eva
