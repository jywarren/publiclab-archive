# The new Questions page design is ready to be reviewed :) 

Hello all,

As you might already know, I've been working with the team on simplifying the overall design of Public Lab - making it a more accessible and effective website for everyone :)

We are putting a special focus on organising all the information that is constantly added to the page.

We want to enable you to contribute to the website as conveniently as possible (and in a way that your work won't get lost!) and at the same time, stay up to date - especially on topics of your interest.

The design for the Questions Page is a work in progress. If you have any ideas on how to make it better, I would love to hear from you! (you can answer this post)

The design can be found here: [https://edieblu.github.io/pl-dashboard/](https://edieblu.github.io/pl-dashboard/)

If you scroll down you will also see the Dashboard design. This is so you can see how the two pages connect to each other :)

Thank you for reading this.

Eva
