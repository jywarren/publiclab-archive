# Another low-fi pendulum rig

###What I want to do
fly a point and shoot safely, on a $1 budget.

###My attempt and results
I just put this thing together, and so far it looks like it would survive rough landing in any angle, protecting the lens on a hard fall, and dragging around on impact.

The connection between the rig and the dowel suspension is stronger than you'd imagine, relying mostly on the rubber bands, but the stopper provides a stop-gap. A stopper gap?
###Questions and next steps
I would insist on a rigid, non-rubber-band connection to prevent camera from falling on someone's head. This could simply be  a lanyard connection up to the kite string.

###Why I'm interested
Want to provide options for a DIY rig kit.
