# quick and dirty lanyard attachment for mobius camera

###What I want to do
provide a failsafe attachment to a mobius camera for aerial photography applications

###My attempt and results
One design issue with mobius cams is the lack of a simple lanyard attach point. I thought about drilling out one in the housing, but then noticed there is a bit of daylight visible through the backmost hole in the camera body:

This allows a paperclip to pass through, which could then become an attach point to tie off a string up to the flyline, in case of failure of the camera mount.
