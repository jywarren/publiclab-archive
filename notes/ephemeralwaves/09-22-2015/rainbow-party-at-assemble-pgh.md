# Rainbow Party at Assemble PGH

###What I want to do
Share the spectrometer made from the Public Lab spectroscope kit at the Assemble PGH learning party. 

###My attempt and results
We pointed the spectroscope at fluorescent, mercury, and led light and showed the people gathered what each spectrum looked like.
