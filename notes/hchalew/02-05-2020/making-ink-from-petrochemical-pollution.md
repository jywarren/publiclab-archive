# Making ink from petrochemical pollution?

I'm artist living in New Orleans, and my [artwork](http://www.hannahchalew.com/) explores climate change, the fossil fuel
industry and the future of the Louisiana landscape.

I
source my materials from the environment, including making my own paper and
ink. I'm wondering if it might be possible to somehow distill particulate
matter from petrochemical pollution in areas like Cancer Alley, to create an
ink from. There is a [company in India that works with diesel pollution to create an
ink](http://www.graviky.com/air-inktrade.html "http://www.graviky.com/air-inktrade.html"), and
am curious if an ink could be produced to help visualize the pollution in this
region and be used to create artwork to bring awareness to these issues. 

I'm
working on a grant to partner with a scientist to work on this project, if
anyone knows of anyone who might be interested in working on this with me,
please send me their info. Thank you
