# CFL Bulb

Build a self-made mini-spectrometer (many instructions & guidelines online available), put the side with the DVD-R surface onto a webcam or smartphone-camera and fix it so that it can't move anymore. Bring it close to the light source (CFL bulb) and capture and calibrate the visible spectrum via www.spectralworkbench.org.
