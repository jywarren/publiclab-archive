# Aside from a wavelength calibration, has there been any discussion on doing some sort of intensity calibration to allow measurement of spectral irradiance? 

Knowing that, calculation of other attributes such as color and correlated color temperature is easy. As for a calibration source, one could use published data for solar spectral irradiance for a given terrestrial area. Food for thought. BTW: in ballpark figures, what is the cost of construction using the parts you have on-hand? Excellent project!
