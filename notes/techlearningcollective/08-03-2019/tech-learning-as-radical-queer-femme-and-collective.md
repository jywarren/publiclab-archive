# Tech Learning as Radical, Queer, Femme, and Collective

Hi Public Lab!

We are the Tech Learning Collective, a queer femme-led technology education collective based in New York City. Our website describes us as "an educational initiative run by radical
queer and femme technologists offering unparalleled, low-cost computer
classes primarily to marginalized groups and individuals who are
politically engaged."

In practice, this means we run workshops across various venues in New York City, some paid and some by-donation, on topics ranging from physical lockpicking to using Tor and Tor Browser, to Open PGP, all the way to our Radical Infrastructures series, in which we introduce community organizing groups to setting up their own digital infrastructure to managing Free and Open Source applications. We also run longer form courses ranging from network engineering to system administration to cybersecurity.

We ally ourselves with myriad community organizing groups across the five Boroughs, and work closely with [AnarchoTech NYC](https://github.com/anarchotechnyc), who specifically publishes materials for self-organizing in a train-the-trainers type model. (Check out their [Train the Trainers section](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/tree/master/train-the-trainers) on GitHub!)

We are excited to discover Public Lab for the first time and hope that we can contribute to meaningful praxis within and beyond New York City. Hello! :)
