# Oil testing kit: Making measurements 

Back to work. Yesterday recorded most of the spectra. It was necessary to add two layers of the cardboard material under the spectrometer section for it to align well with the laser path. This was about the same distance that the collimating slit was offset from the line printed on the box. No big deal.

Also noted that a sturdier base could be made to hold the sample cells the better as the cells sometimes tilt.  

I will report soon.
