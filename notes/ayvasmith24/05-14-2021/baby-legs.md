# Baby legs 

throughout this year my biology class has been studying the effects of microplastics in different water systems. We also studied ways to filter out these plastics. Earlier this week the honors biologies classes went to city park to test out the baby leg filter method. Thank you public lab for funding this field trip. It was very informative and it was a fun way to perform this experiment.
