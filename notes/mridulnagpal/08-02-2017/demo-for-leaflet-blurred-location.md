# Demo for leaflet-blurred-location

This library will be used to geo-tag the research notes, it comes with a co-ordinated graticule which would help to find events happening nearby. There are several functions associated with this library, all of them can be found in the docs. I am posting a screenshot of the working library here and will give the link too. All the input listeners are integrated with the leaflet map, so feel free to play around. Any form of feedback would be well appreciated.

The link for the current repo is: https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location

The working demo can be found at: https://publiclab.github.io/leaflet-blurred-location/examples/
