# Inexpensive conductivity probe   Step 1 - Sensor Probe design (revised)

Here are some sketches for a couple of probes I'm going to test. I'm planning on housing the probe in a three inch PVC elbow because that will be easy to attach to the domestic plumbing between the well and any water treatment. The same probe housing should be usable in springs and streams to monitor surface water.

Feedback or ideas around probe geometry is appreciated.
