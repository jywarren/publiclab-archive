# Kite Mapping on the Kill Van Kull

The North Shore Waterfront Conservancy of Staten Island is partnering with Public Lab and NY/NJ Baykeeper for a morning of kite mapping along the north shore of Staten Island, via motorboat. This effort is part of a larger project, funded by the NY DEC, to map industrial runoff and flood barriers (or lack thereof) along the north shore. 

We will meet on June 27th at 9:30 a.m., location TBA.

We have room for one more volunteer, preferably with motor boat experience. If you're interested, please email  plots-nyc@googlegroups.com.
