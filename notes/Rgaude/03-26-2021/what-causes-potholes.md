# What causes potholes?

I live in LaPlace, Louisiana (near New Orleans), and I was brainstorming ideas about local environmental problems when potholes came to mind. I have a lot of questions about them: what causes potholes? how are potholes fixed? how are they prevented? and does soil affect them?
