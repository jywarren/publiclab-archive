# The Pothole Problem: A New Orleans Pothole Project

Problems:

- Heavy traffic is causing road damage
- Sinking soil can cause potholes
- Certain areas have more potholes than others

- Soil plays a part in potholes
- Weather heavily affects the road  

Problems broke down:

- Heavy traffic is causing road damage
  - What was the road originally designed for?
  - How is the road used now?
  - What is the area around the road?
  - What weather affects the road?

- What benefits come from filling the potholes?
- How much impact does soil have on preventing potholes?  

Plan to research problem:

- We need to observe existing roads that are similar apart from traffic.  

Possible Solutions:

- Restrict semi-truck traffic
- Redesign and rebuild the road
- Repair the existing road then build another road on top of it
- Relocate where the semi-trucks are going
- Create a different road that leads to the same destination   

Testing Solutions:

- We can observe other situations like this one and see what they changed to fix this problem.
- We can conduct research to look at possible solutions.

Best Possible Solutions: 

- My solution is to reinforce the road so that it can support the semi-truck traffic it frequently encounters. 
- A possible solution would be to modify the soil to better reinforce the road.
