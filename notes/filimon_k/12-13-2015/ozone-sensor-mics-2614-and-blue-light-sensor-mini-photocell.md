# Ozone sensor (MiCS-2614) and Blue light sensor (mini photocell)

###What I want to do

Create two types of wearable sensors using arduino based platform: One is an ozone sensor, the other is blue light detector. 

###My attempt and results

We are able to calibrate the ozone sensor and have a working calibration system which had been an issue for over two months. Filtering specific wavelength of blue light (450-470nm) had been a challenge because we couldn't find filter's easily.  

###Questions and next steps

Can we use mini arduinos and rechargeable battery source along with data logging shield that incorporates GPS, SD card and clock to develop a wearable version of our sensors?   

###Why I'm interested

Ozone is an air pollutant and an airway irritant to humans while blue light, particularly emitted from cell phone display is associated with sleep cycle disruption.
