# Hyperlocal Air Quality Dataset for California Regions

Aclima partnered with Google to develop hyperlocal measurements of Carbon Dioxide (CO₂), Ozone (O₃), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), Nitric Oxide (NO), Methane (CH₄), Black Carbon (BC), and fine particulate matter in San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and the California Central Valley. They affixed fast-response laboratory-grade air quality sensors to Google Streetview cars, which means they are able to measure block-by-block changes in AQ and the impacts of point sources. While the dataset is not completely publicly available, researchers (including community scientists) can request access through [**this Google Form**][1]! It takes them around a week to review your request.

Check out their [website][2]  and [this paper][3] for more information.
