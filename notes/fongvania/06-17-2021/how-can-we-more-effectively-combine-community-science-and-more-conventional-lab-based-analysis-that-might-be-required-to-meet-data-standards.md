# How can we more effectively combine community science and more conventional lab-based analysis that might be required to meet data standards?

Some challenges/considerations that come to mind:

- Repeatability of measurements in environments that you don't have full control over
- Community members with limited scientific background
- When do we need standards vs when are best practices sufficient?
- Obtaining sufficient sample size
