# Edmonton Balloon and Kite Mapping Workshop

####**Date:** Saturday, November 22, 2014, 1-4pm
####**Location:** Humanities Centre 3-86, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, CANADA

Have you ever wanted to make a map of your neighborhood or city? Is buying a drone out of your price range? Do you own a point and shoot camera and want to take pictures from the sky? Join Public Lab organizer and Fulbright researcher Ann Chen for a three hour grassroots mapping workshop where you can learn how to make your own aerial image maps using kites, weather balloons and inexpensive digital cameras.

Ann is a visual artist and Visiting Research Fellow in the English and Film Studies Department at the University of Alberta on a Fulbright Fellowship, where she is doing research for a multimedia documentary project on pipelines and the oil sands industry. In addition to traditional methods of documentation (audio, video and photograph), she is interested in incorporating a collective storytelling element through organizing community mapping activities and collecting environmental data. She has been a member of Public Lab since 2013 and became an organizer in 2014. Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab) is an open community supported by a non-profit organization that investigates and explores environmental concerns through inexpensive and accessible DIY techniques, to increase awareness and accountability.

We will be meeting at the **Humanities Centre, Room 3-86**. Please **RSVP** at hhchen@ualberta.ca to receive more information on what you'll need and what to expect. This event is organized in partnership with the English and Film Studies Department at the University of Alberta.

- PET plastic juice or soda container, 64 oz or 2 Liter bottle, wide enough to fit your camera
