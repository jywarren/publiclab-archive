# What actions can residents take to use environmental data to make an impact in their community? 

I'm working with a local NGO and some volunteers to collect environmental data on stormwater management in green infrastructure in their area. I'm hoping to gain some insight into what communities typically do with environmental data once it is collected and what steps residents can take to use that data for improving their neighborhood. 

  
Are there specific steps that I can recommend that can help them contribute to policy change? Is there a certain way that the data collected can be shared with government institutions? What other efforts can environmental data help contribute to?

  
The end goal is to create a guide for volunteers and community organizations that have collected environmental data to help them figure out next steps as to what to do with it that can bring about actionable change.
