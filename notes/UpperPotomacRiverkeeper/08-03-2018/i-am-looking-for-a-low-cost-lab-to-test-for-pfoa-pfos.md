# I am looking for a low cost lab to test for PFOA/PFOS. 

I am working with a community of residents that may have been impacted by the pollutant PFOA/S from a nearby Air National Gaurd facility that performed firefighting drills using AFFF. The recent EPA drinking water guidance released for PFOA/S triggered a review of all public water utilities near military bases that used this fire suppression chemical. The Martinsburg, WV area did have the public water system show levels of PFOA/S that were hire than the EPA guidance. The public water system has been upgraded, however, local residents on well water also in close proximity to the military base are susceptible to well water contamination of PFOA/S.

  
I am looking for a lab that tests for PFOA/S that is low cost. The lowest I have been able to find is $275 a sample. I have ten resident wells to test and would also like to test near by springs.
