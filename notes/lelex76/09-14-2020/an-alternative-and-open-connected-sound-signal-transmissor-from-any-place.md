# an alternative and open connected sound signal transmissor from any place 

am interested in build alternative sound signal transmission and connection ( trough antenna may be : radio?) with internet

  
That all!!!!!

  
And incorporate to one manual weaving loom is for site-specific performance

and it should sound the signal with an amplification ( not much) in a physical place
