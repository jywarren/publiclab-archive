# Air quality balloons - an updated version?

Hello All!

Back in 2010 Stacy Kuznetsov crated an amazing visual tool for air quality awareness: [](https://www.instructables.com/id/Air-quality-balloons/)[](https://www.instructables.com/id/Air-quality-balloons/)[](https://www.instructables.com/id/Air-quality-balloons/)[https://www.instructables.com/id/Air-quality-balloons/](https://instructables.com/id/Air-quality-balloons/)

I wanted to know if any of you have made this (I have but in 2012) and/or if you have any leads on recent versions of this tool.

A friend of mine, Max Wakefield is looking to create a set of these for the upcoming UK-wide campaign.

Any leads/ideas would be much appreciated!

Best,

Cindy
