# Can more info on  colormaps be added to image-sequencer?

I know there are different ways to use color maps depending on the situation but it would be helpful to understand the settings of the default, stretched and fastie colormaps as well as when they might be best used. I am trying to optimize camera settings (see below) and without a color bar NDVI high/ low reference it is difficult to tell which is the best NDVI result?![image description](/i/25831.jpg "Slide1.JPG")![image description](/i/25832.jpg "Slide2.JPG")...Thx...
