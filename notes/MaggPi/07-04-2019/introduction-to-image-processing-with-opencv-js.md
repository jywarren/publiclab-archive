# Introduction to Image Processing with OpenCV.js

Abstract: The note provides a tutorial for the javascript (js) version of  openCV.js  image processing  software.   The tutorial is designed for beginner programmers and provides an [introduction to software design techniques](https://youtu.be/4nryLZMCKgo)  as well as how to establish an  openCV.js operating environment.      

**Introduction:**  

- [OpenCV.js](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/df/d0a/tutorial_js_intro.html)  provides a variety of optimized algorithms that can be utilized for  computer vision web applications ranging from feature detection  to image measurement. 

- This tutorial demonstrates how to use opencv.js asynchronously and without compiling.  The goal is to make opencv.js applications more accessible for the beginner user.

- Software for this tutorial is free and is available at [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)   and [OpenCV.js](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html).   Visual Studio Code is demonstrated as a good development environment for Public Lab software applications.  

- This note is part of a larger effort [(Public Lab GSOC 2019)](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-06-2019/a-big-welcome-to-our-outreachy-gsoc-team-for-2019) to develop openCV applications for Public Labâ€™s [Image Sequencer](https://sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/#steps=)  multi-purpose image processing tool.   In order to enable advanced Image Sequencer applications, a standalone opencv.js environment is useful to debug code before integration into Image Sequencer.      

**Tutorial/Demo**
Opencv.js tutorial is available via github at https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/blob/master/HowToUseOpenCVInJavaScript.md.   The tutorial provides an example of how openCV.js can be used to transform images  from color to black and white and reduce  image size.   A demonstration video of several images is available at https://youtu.be/4nryLZMCKgo.

**Summary**

OpenCV.js provides optimized algorithms for several different image processing tasks.   This tutorial   provided annotated code and demonstrated processing of  PNG, TIFF and JPG files as large as 40MB.
