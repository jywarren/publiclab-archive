# Which Public Lab kit is  best  for testing the impact of different camera settings?


I am requesting advice on which Public lab kit would be best  for testing the impact of different camera settings.

The goal is to adapt a public lab kit to help answer spectrometer camera optimization questions (see for example: https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/09-28-2016/upgrade-a-diy-spectrometer-with-a-raspberry-pi-camera and https://publiclab.org/notes/cedarlodge/03-07-2018/raspberry-pi-spectrometer-gui)

I plan to use a Raspberry Pi (v3), Pi visible (v2)/NOIR cameras and picamera/opencv software with a public lab spectrometry kit.   Public lab spectrometer kits range from desktop 3.0 (intended for webcam), lego kit (intended  for both webcam or v1 camera) and flexible (intended for mobile phone cameras).  While I understand that the kits are priced for different applications, is there a comparison table available that lists the specifications and advantages/disadvantages of each design?    Particularly interested in wavelength resolution, wavelength accuracy/ repeatability, spectral range  and ability to match to Pi v2 cameras for each design.

Also interested if anyone is interested in collaborating on testing different kits with Raspberry Pi  v2 cameras, writing code to cycle thru different exposure settings or  testing options for different (manual) camera settings.
