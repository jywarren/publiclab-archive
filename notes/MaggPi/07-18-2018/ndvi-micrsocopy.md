# NDVI microscopy

My first use of  image-sequencer  https://publiclab.github.io/image-sequencer/examples/#steps=    so I am not sure what to expect..
   
Image examples are microscopic images of plant cells.  IR image was collected with a 850nm LED.  Color image with a white light LED.   I know NDVI is designed for remote sensing applications so I am not sure if this is worthwhile?  Also not sure if microscope slide and cover glass  changes image spectral properties? 

First image is a Pine Leaf example.  Is that the right image sequence for NDVI analysis?

Second image is of a leaf and has a flat field image problem.  Can you add flat field correction to Image sequencer?    I believe the supplied version of the Raspberry Pi camera has itâ€™s own flat field correction and we need to provide  an alternate correction when the Pi camera is used with a different (objective) lens.

Image sequencer works great (amazingly easy to use) but I am a little nervous as to it how it actually works.  My experience with photoshop and opencv  is that  processing steps often depend  on many decisions that depend on the situation.
