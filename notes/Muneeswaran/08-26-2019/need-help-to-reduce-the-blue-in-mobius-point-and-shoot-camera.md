# Need help to reduce the Blue in mobius point and shoot camera

Hi all,

I am using mobius point and shoot camera and customized white balance setting (R-250, G-500, B-900). It it still shows blue values ( see the rooftop of the shops). What could be the problem here. How to reduce the blue from the image?![image description](/i/34876.jpg "IMAG0246.jpg")
