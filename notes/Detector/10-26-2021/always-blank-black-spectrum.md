# Always blank, black spectrum

I am trying to use spectrum workbench on a mac with Firefox. I eventually managed to get logged in from Public Lab.   When I start capture, I allow Firefox to use the camera.  Then I get the screen with the horizontal black lines, but no response at all from the camera.
