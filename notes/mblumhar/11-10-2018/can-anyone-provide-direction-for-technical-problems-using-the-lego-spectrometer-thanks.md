# Can anyone provide direction for technical problems using the lego spectrometer thanks

I apologize if this is the incorrect forum, if so please point me in the right direction. We assembled raspberry pi lego spectrometer using the Pi NoIR Camera Module V2\. We installed the latest version of Raspbian. The camera works fine with picamera. Our browsers (chromium and firefox) are both set to allow camera access. When we run web based spectralworkbench it indicates it is still awaiting camera access. We downloaded spectral workbench.py and have been unable to get that to work. Any suggestions would be much appreciated thanks
