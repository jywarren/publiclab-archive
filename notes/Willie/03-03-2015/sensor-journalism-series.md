###When, where, what
Tues, Feb. 24 @ 5PM ET - Sensor Journalism Kickoff with Fergus Pitt, Tow Center for Digital Journalism
Sun, March 8 @ 1PM ET - Sensor Design and Deployment with Travis Hartman (KBIA noise pollution project), Matt Schroyer (DustDuino)

###Background
Speakers in this month long series include practitioners, educators, developers, experimenters, and supporters of sensor journalism to share and discuss their work, then hold a brief Q&A afterward. We hope to expand on existing research on sensor journalism, as captured by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism’s Sensors & Journalism report, along with best practices, as learned through experience and experiment (e.g. [DustDuino](http://publiclab.org/wiki/dustduino), the Open Water Project). Everyone’s invited — including you! 

All the sessions will be archived and hosted on the OKCast website in an effort to build a working knowledge base for sensor journalism beyond informal discussions and meetings on and offline.
