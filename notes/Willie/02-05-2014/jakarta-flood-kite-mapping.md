# Jakarta Flood Kite Mapping 

###Jakarta is flooding and it happens every year. 

I work with a network of environmental journalists and we make maps. We sourced flooding data from local disaster response agency. The flood looks like [this]( http://ekuatorial.com/maps/jakarta-flood-2014).

So we knew where to go and headed out with a kite and a gopro hero 3 to try and make a map. We ended up with some cool pictures. Here is the link to our[ facebook album ](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1476646499229502.1073741832.1434013790159440&type=1&l=498a689040)

The gopro didn't seem to need the crash cage and it often obscured the images. It was also quite difficult to get a 90 degree shot with the gopro lens. Many photos were pretty but hard to use in MapKnitter.

After this experience, I am thinking that a design for a gopro picavet is a good idea. I also think that kite mapping is great fun.
