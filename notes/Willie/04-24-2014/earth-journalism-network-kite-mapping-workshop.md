# Earth Journalism Network Kite Mapping Workshop

###Event details

Just across the water from the richest country in California is Richmond, a hot spot of industrial pollution. We're using kites and cameras to build our own map of the day in order to illustrate particulate and noise sensor data we are also collecting. This will start at 4pm on Monday April 28th at Barbara and Jay Vincent Park in Richmond Harbor. 

###Background

This workshop will be led by Stewart Long and is being organized for the Earth Journalism Network regional partners. We are doing this in order to demonstrate the practice for adoption in other countries.
