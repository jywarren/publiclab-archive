# Question: Stray light correction

I'm interested in adapting this DIY Spectrometer into a Spectrophotometer and was wondering if the [NIST Stray Light correction formula](http://www.nist.gov/pml/div685/grp03/spectroradiometry_straylight.cfm) has been or would be integrated into Spectral Workbench code?
