# Are there any tools for measuring Ra 226/Ra228 contained in deicers?

Repeatedly there are concerns about the brine being used on roads to reduce the use of "salt".

New solutions are being introduced where beet juice and various 
formulations are now being used as a means of reducing the additional 
"salt"  to create safer roads and cleaner run-off. However some of these chemical deicers may contain higher that 
acceptable levels of radium/radiation. Anyone know of tools that can be 
used to detect levels this sort of contamination in some of the commercial products being developed?
