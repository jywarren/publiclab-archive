# How do I  identify the base polymers in an unknown plastic for recycling? 

Has public labs spectrometry work ever been used to identify the base 
polymers in an unknown plastic for recycling? Anything like an OS FTIR 
in the right range ready for show time? Thank you for your help - [Joshua Pearce](https://www.appropedia.org/User:J.M.Pearce)
