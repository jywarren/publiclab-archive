**Behind the name of the document:**
"Using a phrase during the meeting that has since become famous across Brazil, [Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo] Salles urged the state governors to take advantage of the mainstream media’s hyper-focus on the COVID-19 pandemic in order to get to work “**passando a boiada**” (pushing through the cattle). That’s a ranching term originally referring to the rounding up of cattle to quickly get them across a river — a phrase which Observatório do Clima used as the title to its report. Salles was explicit in his meaning: “There’s an enormous list of things we can simplify in all the ministries that have a regulatory role. We don’t need Congress,” he said.

**Overview given by Mongabay:**

 - A new report documents draconian budget cuts to Brazilian
   environmental monitoring and firefighting of 9.8% in 2020, and 27.4%
   in 2021 — reductions, analysts say that were inflicted by the
   Bolsonaro administration in “a clear policy for dismantling national
   environmental policies.”

 - Brazil’s environmental agencies under Bolsonaro have also been
   subjected to nearly 600 administrative and rules changes, invoked by
   presidential executive order and resulting in massive environmental
   deregulation.

 - Faced with Bolsonaro’s gutting of environmental agencies and
   protections, two Indigenous leaders — Kayapo Chief Raoni Metuktire,
   and Paiter Surui Chief Almir Narayamoga Surui — have asked the
   International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague to investigate
   President Bolsonaro for “crimes against humanity.”
