# Has anyone here ever used the Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA) for organizing around an environmental concern? 

I'd love to hear how this database supported your community needs or fell short. Plus any best "how to use" tips you may have to share. I recently learned that NOAA adds Oil Spill data to this database for the Pacific Northwest Region, which is what sparked my curiosity.

About: [The Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA)](https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/resources/maps-and-spatial-data/environmental-response-management-application-erma) is an online mapping tool that integrates both static and real-time data, such as Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps, ship locations, weather, and ocean currents, in a centralized, easy-to-use format for environmental responders and decision makers.

##### ERMA is designed to:

- Visualize information relevant to spill preparedness and planning.
- Assist in coordinating emergency response efforts and situational awareness for human and natural disasters.
- Support the [Natural Resource Damage Assessment process](https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/environmental-restoration/natural-resource-damage-assessment.html).
- Aid in ecological recovery and restoration efforts.
