# [Talk Recording] Mobilizing People to Act on Air Pollution with the Bucket Air Monitor - a Community Science Tool

The Open Source Hardware Association - 2021 Virtual Open Hardware Summit

[*Link to recording*; 15mins] 
Talk Title: "[Mobilizing People to Act on Air Pollution with the Bucket Air Monitor - a Community Science Tool][1]" 

**Synopsis of recorded talk**:

*The “bucket” is a low-cost, community-friendly air sampler that helps people measure toxic chemicals such as benzene and hydrogen sulfide in their air. Developed in the late 1990s, it was one of the first (if not the very first) do-it-together environmental monitors. Communities living near oil refineries and petrochemical plants gathered to build their own buckets. They established phone trees to make sure that, when noxious fumes enveloped their neighborhood, someone would take a sample.
Twenty years later, buckets continue to be a critical tool for fenceline communities impacted by oil and gas development.*
