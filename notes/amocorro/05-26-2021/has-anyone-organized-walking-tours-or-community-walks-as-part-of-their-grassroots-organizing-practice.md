# Has anyone organized "walking tours" or  "community walks" as part of their grassroots organizing practice?

How have you threaded together local knowledge and histories where you are? There has been some discussion at Public Lab around the value of walking tours and community walks.

**I am wondering:**
*Have you ever created a toxic tour, environmental justice historical walking tour, or other informative community walks where you live? If so, how did you start?* 

**Perhaps you haven't created one...***Have you participated in one and/or experienced going on one? Where were you and what elements of the walk were striking to you?*  

If you have any to recommend (anywhere in the world), please share them in the replies below!
Appreciate any links to reference as well. Thank you!
