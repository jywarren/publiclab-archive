# Are you sampling local air quality? Are you sending results to a lab? Ask these questions! 

These comments were originally shared by *Public Lab Frontline Community Organizer Fellow* @sarasage, follow along with their Val Verde air quality monitoring team project here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/vvamp

**Preparing to use the Bucket Air Monitoring tool**

Sara: 
We are very close to being able to use our bucket kits in the field and want to thank everyone who made a reliable kit based on the CBE buckets. This was the number one tool my community was searching for when were learning about air monitoring.

I want to add a few items that I have found useful when finding and working with a lab:

**Questions to ask**

- Do you have a courier service or can you refer us to one? (Courier services will transport your air sample to the lab. A number of tests require that the sample be analyzed within 24 hours).

- Can you give us copies of the chain of custody forms? Chain of custody forms are supplied by the lab and you will need to use their form.

- Can you give us a list of the test/methods you perform, as well as a price list?
