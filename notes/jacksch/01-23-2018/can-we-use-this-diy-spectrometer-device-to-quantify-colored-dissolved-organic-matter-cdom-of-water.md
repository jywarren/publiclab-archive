# Can we use this DIY spectrometer device to quantify colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) of water?

We would like to know the possibility to use this DIY spectrometer for CDOM data for water, like rivers, estuaries, and sea. We would like to use this data for remote sensing study, to build model based on satellite image to estimate and predict water parameters.  
Thank you.
