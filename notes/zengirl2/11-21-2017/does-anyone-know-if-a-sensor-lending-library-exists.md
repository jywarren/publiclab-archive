# Does anyone know if a sensor lending library exists?

Although Public Lab has mentioned a library for using kits, I'm seeing a need for something much like a community tool library where people could borrow professional sensors for a time period to analyze a problem. Usually these devices are cost prohibitive, but as a library they may become feasible.
