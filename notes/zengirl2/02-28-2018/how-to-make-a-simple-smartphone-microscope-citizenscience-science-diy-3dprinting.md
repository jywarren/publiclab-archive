# How to Make a Simple Smartphone Microscope #citizenscience #science #DIY #3dprinting

A recent post on [Digital Trends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/3d-printed-smartphone-micrscope/) discussed a 3d printed attachment for a smartphone that allows it to become a microscope. The plastic piece uses a tunnel to channel the light from the camera's flash to the sample plate. The 3D print files and notes are available on [Centre for Nanoscale BioPhotonics, Australia ](http://cnbp.org.au/online-tools) and the only other item needed is a phone camera lens module (which is quite inexpensive). Its capability is described as "strong enough to visualize specimens as small as a two-hundredth of a millimeter."
