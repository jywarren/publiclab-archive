# Do you know of a success story of DIY monitoring for factory farm related problems?

I would like encourage other people who are experiencing factory farm issues to try monitoring. Hopefully your story will give them the courage they need to take the next step to get data. Of course a Public Lab tool example would be great, but really any story is helpful.
