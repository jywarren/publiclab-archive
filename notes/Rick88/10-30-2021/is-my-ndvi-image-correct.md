# Is my NDVI image correct?

Hi,

I managed to mod a camera to capture both VIS and NIR images as below :-

  
Visible (RGB) image

NIR Image

Following tutorial here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nNnWEHNO\_w), I managed to generate the image map below.

As this is my 1st time making NDVI image, I am not sure if this is good NDVI or not. please help
