# Suppression of background light

###What I want to do or know
How can I suppress background light of a spectra?

###Background story
With your fold able spectroscope I am unable to get a spectra on my screen. However, by placing a piece of DVD on the webcam I can get one with lot of background light. Theramino software provide this option but initial setting is very difficult. In your software initial setting is easy but I could not find any way to suppress background light.
