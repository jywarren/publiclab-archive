# Seeking DC-area folks interested in building temperature sensors for urban heat island measurement

Looking for DC folks who would be willing/able to facilitate or participate in workshops to discuss programs on sensing the urban heat island in our area and/or build systems to measure temperature by bicycle.

I posted about the broader context [here](https://publiclab.org/questions/carohowe/07-13-2017/what-are-ways-to-record-ambient-temperature-every-5-sec-and-export-easily), and some of the solutions that seem the best would require building some systems beyond our team's technical capacity. We would need access to soldering equipment and some volunteers! We can cover costs of equipment and potentially someone to facilitate such a session.
