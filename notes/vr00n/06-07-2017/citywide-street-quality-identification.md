# Citywide Street Quality Identification

Please follow through on.  

https://www.hackster.io/argo/squid-street-quality-identification-a43367\.  

  
As of last week, we have started using [Open Street Cam](http://www.openstreetcam.org) to source our imagery and are surveying NYC bike lanes.

  
We are in the process of documenting for reproducibility.
