# What are plausible uses for reclaimed mining land? 

Ideally, reclamation is a 2-part process: first to minimize the harmful environmental effects during mining activity and second to return mined land to a “beneficial end use” ([source][1]). I’m interested in this term—beneficial end use—and what the obstacles may be that limit the land use options for previously mined areas.

Do options vary by the type of mine and the duration of mining activities? Could mined land ever become something like a park or playground?
