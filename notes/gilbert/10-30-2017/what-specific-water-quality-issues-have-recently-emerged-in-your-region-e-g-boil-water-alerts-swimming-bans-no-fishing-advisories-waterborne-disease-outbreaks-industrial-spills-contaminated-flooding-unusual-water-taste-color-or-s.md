# What water quality issues have recently emerged in your region, i.e. "boil water alerts," "swimming ban," "no fishing advisories," "water-borne disease outbreaks," "industrial spills," "contaminated flooding," "unusual water taste, color or smell"?

The objective would be to develop a spatial database, indicating populations and ecosystems at risk for specific water quality threats, thereby facilitating networking and collective advocacy to effectively address problems and to promote sustainable clean water resources.
