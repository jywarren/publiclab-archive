# In addition to testing for pH, what other water quality testing have you utilized, such as turbidity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), etc.? Can you share your experience with these?

In responding to this question, would it be helpful to view Public Lab's spreadsheet on water sensors: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/water-sensors](https://publiclab.org/wiki/water-sensors) and/or Public Lab's wiki on pH Testing & Community Science: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/ph-testing-and-citizen-science](https://publiclab.org/wiki/ph-testing-and-citizen-science) ?
