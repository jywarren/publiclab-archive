# Have you had any experience utilizing low cost portable microscopes?  

              
 
There is an increasing need for communities impacted by environmental degradation to have access to affordable microscopy, in order to identify sources of contamination. Sharing your experience, insights, recommendations, successes and or problems encountered would greatly benefit such communities. 

@stevie and I have initiated a wiki page on low cost microscopes and their diverse applications. Please share your comments here or feel free to edit the wiki page: www.publiclab.org/wiki/microscope
