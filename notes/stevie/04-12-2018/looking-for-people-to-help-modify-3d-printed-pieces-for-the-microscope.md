# Looking for people to help modify 3d printed pieces for the microscope.

Hello!
Do you have a 3D printer?
Are you interested in building design files or helping us print parts?

GREAT!!
We need:

- New print files for the microscope to make a universal Raspberry Pi Camera holder. Here are some notes on what we're looking for on [Open Flexure's microscope page](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/issues/71).
- Once we have these two pieces fixed, we need help getting a bunch printed so we can get the first test microscopes out to people!

Comment below if you're interested in helping. Thanks!
