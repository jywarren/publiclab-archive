# How can you tell if a sheen on water is bacterial or petroleum (oil)? 

Bacterial sheens on water can often look like oil. However, they are completely harmless and natural. I'm interested in simple tests that can help people identify the difference between these two things. Petroleum (oil or gas) sheens and spills need to be reported, the bacteria ones do not.
