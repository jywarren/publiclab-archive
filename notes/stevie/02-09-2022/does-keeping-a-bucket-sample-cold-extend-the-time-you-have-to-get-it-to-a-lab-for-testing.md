# Does keeping a bucket sample cold extend the time you have to get it to a lab for testing? 

We've been struggling to find a lab to do testing for bucket samples in the greater New Orleans area. Does keeping a sample refrigerated extend the time frame we have to get to a lab for testing? I know the bucket samples generally need to get to a lab within 24hours.
