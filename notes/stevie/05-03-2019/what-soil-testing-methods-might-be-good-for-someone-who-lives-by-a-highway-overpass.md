#  What soil testing methods might be good for someone who lives by a highway overpass?

Hi! I just heard from a group who is thinking about doing some soil testing. There was a huge overpass put in their neighborhood a number of years ago, and they're wondering how this might have affected their soil health. Anyone have suggestions?
