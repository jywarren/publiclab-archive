# Is there an easy way (app?) to find my elevation above sea level?

*Posting on behalf of LESBreathe*

Our project came into being because of the potential destruction of the East River Park by NYC. We were concerned about the current air quality, as well as the air quality when the park is destroyed and construction begins. This proposed plan is supposed to turn the park into flood protection for the Lower East Side. There is a group fighting this design and one of the issues raised was whether or not one of the developments across the East River in Brooklyn are at the same elevation and were allowed to be constructed. 

I tried to find the elevation of the park with this site (https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm) but I'm not sure I trust the data because it said I was at Zero at the park when I was clearly above water. 

Is there an app or some other easy way to detect our elevation? I'm also interested in connecting this information with the Purple Airs we have set up in the neighborhood on the Lower East Side.
