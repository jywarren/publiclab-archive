# Could the Raspberry Pi Microscope be used for looking at microplastics found in ocean water?

I was recently speaking with @Bluemountainsurfer about the microscope project. He asked if we could use it to look at microplastics. I thought it could be really interesting! Anyone have ideas on whether this could work?
