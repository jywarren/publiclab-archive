# New Orleans Water Quality Meet-up

See the report on this[ meetup here!](http://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/01-27-2015/january-water-quality-meet-up-report)

Interested in exploring and experimenting a bit with water quality work? Meet us at **Propeller  (4035 Washington Ave.) Saturday, January 24th at 1:00pm**. We’ll visit Bayou St. John’s Scenic Waterway, collect some samples, do some pole mapping and work with the Coqui! 

Come Along! Bring your friends, bring your ideas, bring any tools you'd like to experiment with and we'll make an afternoon of it!
