# What are ways to monitor for oil and gas spills on private property? 

Friends in Colorado were recently in touch looking for ideas on how to monitor for oil and gas spills that happen nearby on private property. Often times when they hear about spills it's days later. There are also concerns that these spills aren't being reported at all. Looking for ideas or resources!
