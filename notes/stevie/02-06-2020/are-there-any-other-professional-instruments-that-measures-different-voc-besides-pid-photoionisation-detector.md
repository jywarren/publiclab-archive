# Are there any other professional instruments that measures different VOC besides PID (photoionisation detector)?

bringing this question asked from @bostonfern    

  
Also, Are the PID VOC meter, which also measures formaldehyde, accurate?   Are they capable of measuring many different kinds of VOCs in one single scan or I have to measure one by one?   Are they accurate?
