# Are there simple tests for nitrates in well water? 

From a local community member: Wisconsin private wells are plagued by nitrates and bacteria from fecal contamination and fertilizer runoff. Landowners too often fail to have wells tested due to cost or finding contamination they cannot afford to deal with. Here in Wisconsin, a basic test for nitrate/bacteria costs around $50 through the health department and requires us to get materials to the lab twice. This test does not include any metal, drug, or hormone testing. Is there any possibility of creating a simple testing device for nitrate that could give results without using a lab?
