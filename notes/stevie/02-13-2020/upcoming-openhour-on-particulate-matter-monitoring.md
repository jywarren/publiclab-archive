Hello!

We'll explore advancements in sensor technology, and discuss reasons why community groups might [choose one method for monitoring over another ](https://publiclab.org/wiki/choosing-a-method-for-particulate-matter-monitoring) given their interests and goals. (We'll update this wiki with info from the call!)
