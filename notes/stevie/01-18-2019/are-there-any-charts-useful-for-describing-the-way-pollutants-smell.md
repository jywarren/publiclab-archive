# Are there any charts useful for describing the way pollutants smell?

We're interested in doing the next Community Science Publication on Odor. One thing that might be interesting for this is to include a chart or material that could help people either describe odors they smell in the air, or that links pollutants to particular smells. I've [found this chart][1], and I'm wondering what people think about it. It seems like it might need an update. Are there other materials like this we could pull from?
