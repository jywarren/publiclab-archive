# Highlights: Working with Communities in the DIY Oil Testing Booklet

The second section of the new DIY Oil Testing Booklet, which we’re highlighting this week, is focused on _Working with Communities_. 

In this section, you will find four workshops ready to help you lead a group through:

* designing an experiment
* building a spectrometer
* calibration and scanning
* finally analyzing your results

Check out the workshops here:


###Workshops

* [Workshops overview](/wiki/oil-testing-workshops)
* [Workshop 1: Design an experiment](/wiki/oil-testing-workshop-design-an-experiment)
* [Workshop 2: Build a spectrometer](/wiki/oil-testing-workshop-build-a-spectrometer)
* [Workshop 3: Calibration and scanning](/wiki/oil-testing-workshop-calibration-and-scanning)
* [Workshop 4: Analyzing and sharing](/wiki/oil-testing-workshop-analyzing-and-sharing)

To highlight #1: 

> The Design an Experiment workshop can be used for anyone who is interested in conducting experiments which make use of the scientific method. It will help you work through understanding the capabilities and limitations of data. Participants in this workshop will be able to learn about the elements needed for good experimental design, identify important points of designing a clear experiment, draft questions and transform them into hypotheses, and explored the concept of proof versus likelihood. 

> This section of the Oil Testing Booklet also explores the nuances of working with both online and offline community members. It provides material on outreach strategies for those working at different stages in projects. It explains how Public Lab run an online program for people to helped identify and to show the ability and limitations of the Oil Testing Kit through replication. 

> For those interested in community tool development, another section in this chapter explores the new concept of “Open open hardware” -- a reference to the fact that many “open hardware” projects are developed in private and only published openly upon completion. By contrast, the process we’ve proposed and begun to adopt is one where the goals includes things like: 
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>low barrier to entry for new contributors</li>
<li>predictable revision timeline</li>
<li>regular iteration and feedback on proposed changes to help them get prepared for the next release due date
<li>a single, consistent, versioned, "baseline" design for the project, emphasizing simplicity & low cost, but upon which advanced mods may be made</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
