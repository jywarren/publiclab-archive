# What are water quality parameters we should monitor to understand our local stream health? 

I'm interested in learning more about what water quality parameters we should be looking into if we're interested in keeping an eye on the health of our local stream. 

- Are there standard parameters we should use?
- Are some parameters better indicators of health than others? 
- Are parameters universal or are there factors we should consider based on where we are or local pressures? 
- Where can we find more resources or materials on this topic?
