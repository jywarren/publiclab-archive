# What are soil sampling protocols being used by groups along the gulf coast?

After we're past the immediate and pressing disaster rescue and response happening from Hurricane Harvey, I've been hearing some concern by people that soil testing is going to become an important thing to consider. There have been a lot of chemical and hazardous material spills from Harvey and it might be important to have materials available about soil sampling protocols. Does anyone have resources around this? Is there anything specific to Texas on this question that people should consider?
