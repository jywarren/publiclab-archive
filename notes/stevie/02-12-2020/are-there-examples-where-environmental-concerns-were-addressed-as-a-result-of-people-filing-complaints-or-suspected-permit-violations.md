# Are there examples where environmental concerns were addressed as a result of people filing complaints (or suspected permit violations)? 

I'm looking to gather a few case studies where people filed complaints against a polluter (for air, water, nuisance, other permit or legal violations) and those complaints were recognized and addressed by an agency, or through the legal system. I'm looking for stories or other media that highlights examples of these.

  
Videos, podcast links, news articles and anecdotes welcome! 

  
Thank you!!
