# Why does my coqui not change frequency in salt water anymore? 

Hello! I have a [coqui][1] that's about two years old. I've used it in a number of demos, and it seems to no longer be changing pitch in salt vs. fresh water. I'm wondering if it has corroded? Perhaps I didn't clean it after my last use? Wondering if anyone has any thoughts!
