# When is it better to do grab sampling versus other types of monitoring?

I've been looking into grab sampling methods, but I'm still unsure of situations where someone might choose to do grab sampling over other types of monitoring.  I'm specifically thinking about air monitoring, but realizing this could go for soil or water as well.
