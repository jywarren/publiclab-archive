# Where can you purchase a bucket for air grab sampling? 

I'm hoping to learn more about where you can buy a bucket to do air grab sampling. I've found some information on how to do the sampling, but am still wondering where you can purchase the buckets.  I'm hoping to build out more information on this page if you have any resources to add! https://publiclab.org/wiki/air-sampling
