# What are some good trouble shooting tips for installing/maintaining a PurpleAir? 

We're aiming to install a number of PurpleAirs in the next few weeks. @tylerknight put together a brief [installation guide for it][1]. Wondering if anyone who has worked with PurpleAir has a moment to put an eye on it to see if you have any suggestions based on your experience with the tool. We're also looking to add any trouble shooting tips for set-up and running it. Any suggestions? @jiteovien @crispinpierce @Cbarnes9 @OrionAllgaier @eustatic
