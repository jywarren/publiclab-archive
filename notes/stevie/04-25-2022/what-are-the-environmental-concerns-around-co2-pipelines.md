# What are the environmental concerns around CO2 pipelines? 

From @pat : I read an article a couple of days ago about pipelines being constructed to carry CO2 throughout the midwestern states for eventual storage of this hazardous product underground. The most disturbing information emphasizes environmental and health concerns. Here is the link:

Please read and pass the information on to others. Local comp plans and ordinances should be in place to protect human life.
