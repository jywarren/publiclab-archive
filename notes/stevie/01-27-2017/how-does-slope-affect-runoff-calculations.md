# How does slope affect runoff calculations? 

###What I want to do or know
Looking at calculations for runoff, where does slope come into play? Is it something I should be accounting for in my runoff equation? 


###Background story
I was writing up an activity for determining "[peak discharge from drainage basin runoff](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/01-27-2017/how-to-determine-peak-discharge-from-drainage-basin-runoff)" but noticed it does not include anything about slope.
