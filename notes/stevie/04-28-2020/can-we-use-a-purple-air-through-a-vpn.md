# Can we use a Purple Air through a VPN? 

Hi! We're working with a couple community members who are interested in using the Purple Air, but they're concerned that it could be traced to their house through the wifi it's set up with. We figured out how to obscure the location enough so they're comfortable with the tool, but we haven't figured out how to manage this wifi usage issue. Was wondering if anyone has ideas on this? Could a VPN be used to address this concern?
