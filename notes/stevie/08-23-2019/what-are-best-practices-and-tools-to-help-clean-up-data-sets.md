# What are best practices and tools to help clean up data sets? 

I was recently at an event in Black River Falls WI with @[crispinpierce](https://publiclab.org/profile/crispinpierce "https://publiclab.org/profile/crispinpierce") and his students @Aleah and @Cbarnes9 who were presenting on the Purple Air data they have been collecting in Western Wisconsin in areas affected by frac sand mining. @Aleah mentioned they have a good bit of data from this that needs to be cleaned up to be used. A lot of it she has been cleaning by hand. I was wondering if people could share some best practices around cleaning data sets, and some tools you're found to be helpful for this? I have a couple, I'll share below!
