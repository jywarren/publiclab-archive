# What do the different colors mean on the Simple Air Sensor?

Collaborators at UW Eau Claire (@[crispinpierce](https://publiclab.org/profile/crispinpierce "https://publiclab.org/profile/crispinpierce") and his students @Aleah and @Cbarnes9) are interested in using the Simple Air Sensor for demonstrations in their presentations around the Purple Air Monitor. What do the colors on the sensor mean? What causes the sensor to change colors? and what's a good way to describe this to people in a demonstration?
