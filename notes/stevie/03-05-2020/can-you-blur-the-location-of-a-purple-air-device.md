# Can you blur the location of a Purple Air device?

I'm interested in learning about how the Purple Air data shows up on the map. -- I've heard some people who are interested in getting them but are concerned with sabotage, or being targeted by a local industry for doing monitoring.  Is there any way to blur the location setting of the Purple Air so it covers a wider area than the direct address? 

For example, Public Lab and iNaturalist use a blurring technique for geographic material. On Public Lab material can show up on a grid set to the user's desired size rather than the precise location. (you can read more about that project here https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-27-2019/blurred-location-and-variable-location-privacy)
