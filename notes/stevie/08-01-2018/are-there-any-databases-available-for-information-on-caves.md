# Are there any databases available for information on caves?

Our friends at Crawford County Stewardship Project have been running an awesome project collecting data on sinkholes with community members, and working to get it shared on an [interactive map][1]. They are interested in including information about caves, but have struggled to find databases with this type of information. Anyone have ideas or resources to share?
