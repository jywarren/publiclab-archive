# Has anyone used a radon test kit? 

###What I want to do or know
I'd like to know more about the low cost radon testing kits the EPA is promoting [here](https://www.epa.gov/radon/find-radon-test-kit-or-measurement-and-mitigation-professional). 

I'd like to know more about people's experience with them: 

- How much are they?
- What is it like to use the kit?  
   - Is it easy?
   - How long does it take?
   - Does it come with clear directions? 
- What do you do after you've run the test? 
   - Does it have to be sent to a lab? If so, who does the analysis? 
   - What do the results looking like? (visual, or just a number?)

Also, if it goes to a lab: Does anyone know how they do the analysis on it?
