# What resources are available to help people monitor noise pollution? 

There is a community here in New Orleans that has been plagued with a 6 lane highway overhead that has physically divided their community. Among other environmental and human health concerns, they face a lot of noise pollution from the interstate. They are interested in being able to document this issue. I'm wondering if anyone knows of resources available to help explore this issue?
