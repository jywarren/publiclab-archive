# How do I find out who is responsible for maintaining the roadway by my house? 

I've been speaking with a community member in Mobile County, Alabama who has been struggling with an adjacent gravel and asphalt processing facilities, and the dust their trucks cause around his home. I'm wondering who has jurisdiction on issues regarding the roadway by his property.
