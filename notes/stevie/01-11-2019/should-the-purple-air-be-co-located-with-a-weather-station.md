# Should the Purple Air be co-located with a weather station?

I know the Purple Air collects data on temperature, pressure and humidity, but we're also wondering if wind speed, and direction might also be important data to collect? 

Wondering what people think about this? If wind data is important, what devices might be useful to pair with the Purple Air. Or, where else could we gather wind data?
