# How do environmental monitoring methods become recognized or official by US regulatory agencies? 

###What I want to do or know
While there are many ways to do environmental monitoring, only some have been approved by various agencies for official data. I'm interested in understanding:

- How do these methods become recognized? 
- Who can do this? 
- What is the process? 
- How often are the approved methods reviewed?
