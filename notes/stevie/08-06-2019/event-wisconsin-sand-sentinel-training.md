###About this event:

Have you seen sand blowing off a frac sand pile? A stream cloudy with sediment coming off a mine? These are potential permit violations that need to be reported.

Reporting environmental concerns when you see them is an important part of the accountability process for any industry. Permits are required for operating any industry including frac sand mines. They are in effect both when the industry is operating, and when they are closed. However, permit violations often go unchecked if no one reports them. Learning how to identify potential permit violations will help our communities to ensure pollution events are caught and dealt with! 

The Sand Sentinel program was created to make identifying and filing suspected permit violations easier to do. In this training, participants will:

- Learn how to identify observable permit violations of the frac sand mining industry, 
- Practice gathering the information required for reporting,
- Identify where permit violations can be reported to, and
- Learn about the value in logging nuisance observations.
