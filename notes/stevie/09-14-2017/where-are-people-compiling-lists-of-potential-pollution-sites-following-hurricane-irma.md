# Where are people compiling lists of potential pollution sites following Hurricane Irma?

I know people are thinking about compiling resources to start this question on response to [Hurricane Harvey](https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/09-12-2017/where-are-people-compiling-lists-of-potential-pollution-sites-following-hurricane-harvey), (more on [Public Lab Harvey page here](http://www.publiclab.org/wiki/harvey). I wanted to make sure there was a space for people who are interested in compiling this about Irma as well. Please ping in if you know anything about those who are organizing around this, or where we might be able to find information!
