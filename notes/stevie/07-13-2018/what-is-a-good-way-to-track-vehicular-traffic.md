# What is a good way to track vehicular traffic?

I've been speaking with a community member in Mobile County, Alabama who has been struggling with an adjacent gravel and asphalt processing facilities, and the dust their trucks cause around his home.

We're interested in exploring more ways to advocate and talk about this issue, and want to know more about how to track vehicular traffic, and use of the roadway.
