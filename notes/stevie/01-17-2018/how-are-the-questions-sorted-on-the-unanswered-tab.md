# How are the questions sorted on the 'Unanswered' tab?

### Please describe the problem (or idea)

> What happened just before the problem occurred? Or what problem could this idea solve?
I went to search for unanswered questions on Public Lab here: https://publiclab.org/questions/unanswered/ but I was confused by the way these questions were sorted. Is there a way to make that more clear? Maybe these should be sorted by most recent unanswered questions first?
