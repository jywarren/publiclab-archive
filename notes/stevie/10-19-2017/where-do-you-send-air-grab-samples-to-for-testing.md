# Where do you send air grab samples to for testing? 

I'm wondering if there are certain labs people use for testing air grab samples? What do I need to look for in a place that offers testing? Are there any certifications that we should look for when picking a lab? Also, are there labs that are more cost effective - for example if we were to go through a university?
