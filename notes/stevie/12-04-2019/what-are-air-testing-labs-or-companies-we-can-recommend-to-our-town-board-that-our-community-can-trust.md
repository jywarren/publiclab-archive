# What are air testing labs or companies we can recommend to our town board that our community can trust?

The @CA4O group and Orangetown community has been struggling with the pollution and odors from [Aluf Plastics for decades](https://publiclab.org/wiki/orangetown-aluf). The town board is interested in getting air quality testing done. While the group has had some experience with labs and testing in the past, it was organized and paid for by the company, and the group finds the testing methods, and lab results untrustworthy.

You can read more about our issue and follow our project on this page: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/orangetown-aluf](https://publiclab.org/wiki/orangetown-aluf "https://publiclab.org/wiki/orangetown-aluf"). There is also [data available](https://publiclab.org/wiki/orangetown-aluf#Data "https://publiclab.org/wiki/orangetown-aluf#Data") on that page that speaks to the type of air pollution the town is dealing with from this industry including Acrolein as well as Ethyl Acetate, Cyclohexane, Methylene Chloride, Hexane, Ethanol, Chloroform, 2-Hexanone (MBK), and Isopropanol.
