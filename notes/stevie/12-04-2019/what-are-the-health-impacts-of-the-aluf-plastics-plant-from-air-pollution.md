# What are the health impacts of the Aluf Plastics Plant from air pollution? 

The Aluf Plastics Plant has been negatively affecting the community of Orangetown for decades. While there is [some data on air quality impacts](https://publiclab.org/wiki/orangetown-aluf#Data), such as increased levels of Acrolein as well as Ethyl Acetate, Cyclohexane, Methylene Chloride, Hexane, Ethanol, Chloroform, 2-Hexanone (MBK), and Isopropanol, the health impacts of exposure to these are unknown. Our children are left covering their faces with their shirts and asking when it will stop smelling. @CA4O welcomes any help to process the information we have and figure out what else can be done to stop these noxious odors.
