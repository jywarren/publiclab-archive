# Update #2: OSIDC Optical Motion Tracking Project

The scope of my thesis project has started to gain focus. The topic of study will be optical motion tracking in the study of biological functions of animals or insects. The project will involve the creation of a motion tracking system that is able to accurately gather data related to a subjects motion. This information can be very useful for researchers to better understand bio-mechanical systems. In the creation of the tracking system, Raspberry Pi V2 Camera Modules may perhaps be used staggered in series to, hopefully, gain depth of subject with 2d images, and the system may further require the use of a separate processing unit to process data.
