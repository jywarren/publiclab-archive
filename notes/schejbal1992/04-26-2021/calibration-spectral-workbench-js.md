# Calibration  spectral-workbench.js

Hello,

I bought one spectrometer. I downloaded on my server your code. Everything work well. But on spectrometer are 3 points to calibrate.  
px -\>nm  
Forexample:  
31-\>388.9  
616-\>632.8  
1093-\>837.8

How I can create this calibration for capture mode?

Thank you
