# PhotosynQ demo, Thursday night at Mach 30

So I've posted a few times about our progress on PhotosynQ, a platform for measuring plant photosynthesis and (potentially) other stuff useful including environmental monitoring.  We're going to be demoing the device and web analysis tool this Thursday at 8:30pm at a Mach 30 Hangout - link is https://plus.google.com/events/ctts7sl10sfi19j9lrfuqonr2mk .  I'd love to get the perspective of other folks in the Public Lab community.  Oh, and if you've never heard of Mach 30, they are an awesome organization promoting open space flight.
