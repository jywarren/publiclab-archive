# Extremely Precise mapping

hello everyone, 
I am a viticultural Agronomist from the McLaren Vale wine region in South Australia

I have been doing aerial maps for a while now, and have seen that a lot of people are interested in mapping here

I create maps very often for my work and would love to help anyone on here if they need.

let me know if you need any maps done and send me an email at 
brad@djsgrowers.com.au 

i will happily help you create some maps

Attached is a Map I have previously done with the Modified Canon A495 that contains 16 photos exported on the lowest quality possible

thanks.
