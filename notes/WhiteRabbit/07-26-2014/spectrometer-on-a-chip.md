# Spectrometer on a chip

I ran across this all-in-one chip while I was just now looking into filter wheels, and I thought you all *might* find it of interest if you hadn't already seen it:  http://opticalfiltershop.com/shop/photodiodes/pixelsensor-8-band-visible-photodiode-array-copy/ 

Are there other sensor chips like this?  I'd be interested if there were a chip that not only covered some narrow bands of the visible range (as this one does) but also covered some bands from the UV and Infrared ranges.
