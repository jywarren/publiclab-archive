# Fire hazard Vulnerability of Buildings based on their proximity to fuel and gas stations.

###What I want to do
Make use of Geospatial Technology to assess the vulnerability of buildings (residential and commercial) to fire hazard based on their closeness to fuel and gas stations.

###My attempt and results
Digitizing of buildings on Open street map.
Acquisition of x,y coordinates of the fuel and gas stations.


###Questions and next steps
How many buildings are vulnerable?
What is the estimated loss?
Are there any regulations binding on the siting of a fuel/gas station?
We will be mapping out the x,y coordinates of the fuel/gas stations
Integrating the data into a GIS system. (ESRI Arcgis platform)

###Why I'm interested****
Fuel/Gas stations are constructed without cautions.
Building share the same fence walls with fuel/gas caution.
I want to make people know the risk involved.
