# Controlled Testing with B&W Film Hydrogen Sulfide Detectors

Above infographic describes procedure for controlled testing of Hydrogen Sulfide Detectors created using <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/jschaffr/10-18-2011/hydrogen-sulfide-testing-black-and-white-film">this method</a>

Sensors were created from <strong>Ilford Multigrade IV RC Deluxe MGD.1M B&W Paper</strong> which was treated minimally with glycerine ($1),Kodak Photoflo 200 (16oz $8), and water (value not quantified).

Test environment is kept at room temperature (70 degrees +/-5) in my apartment in Providence, Rhode Island. 

Results to be posted in following weeks.
