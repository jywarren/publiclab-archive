# 3D model in MeshLab

I tried a few more times without success to display the Hypr3D model from the [Lee, NH cover crop trial balloon mapping photos](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/5-29-2012/lee-nh-plotsfarmhack-meetup) in MeshLab. Above is a snapshot of the MeshLab display of the low resolution model from Hypr3D.  The high resolution version will display the model but without the photo texture mapped on it. Below is the model in Hypr3D. The icon at the upper right will display it full screen.

This is a new version with fewer photos (155 out of 159) and some brightness matching.

You can [download the high or low resolution model here](http://www.hypr3d.com/models/4fc6910e74dbfb0001000091) and try it yourself.

Does anyone know how to make the HighResTexture.jpg display on this model in MeshLab?
