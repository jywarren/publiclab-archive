# Aspen Leaf Miner

<em>Image above: Infrablue NDVI image of quaking aspen leaf with larval mines of the aspen leaf miner.</em>

In the last decade, 3,000,000 acres in Alaska have been affected by leaf damage to quaking aspen trees (<em>Populus tremuloides</em>) caused by the aspen leaf miner (<em>Phyllocnistis populiella</em>). The flattened moth larva feeds on leaf tissue between the upper and lower leaf surfaces, reducing photosynthetic activity and causing early leaf drop.

The aspen leaf miner is a native species which is known to irrupt periodically. For the last several years, groves of aspen trees throughout Interior Alaska have appeared grayish tan from a distance because of extensive damage to leaves. Although the trees' ability to make food via photosynthesis was reduced, most trees survived the multi-year irruption. It appears that the recent outbreak has ended and damage is returning to normal levels.

Infrablue photos were taken with a modified Canon A810 with a Rosco #74 filter. The camera was custom white balanced on a piece of blue origami paper.
