# Vermont Environmental Summit

<em>Top: Paul Burns, VPIRG Executive Director, delivers a State of the State Address at the Vermont Environmental Summit, November 18, 2012.

I spent yesterday with an inspiring group of dedicated and concerned people at the Vermont Environmental Summit sponsored by the Vermont Public Interest Research Group and Toxics Action Center. I attended a workshop by Lauren Hierl (VPIRG) and Sylvia Broude (TAC) about exposure to toxics in Vermont, and learned about the aerial pesticide spraying that happened this summer when a man just 10 miles from my house died after being bitten by a mosquito infected with eastern equine encephalitis. 

I was there to run a workshop introducing Public Laboratory tools and focused on how aerial mapping can be used by communities to highlight their local geography. I gave a short presentation and then had a great 45 minute conversation about how the participants could apply Public Laboratory tools (there was lots of interest in the PLOTS spectrometer). The Prezi I used is below.
