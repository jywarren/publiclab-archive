# IR TreeKIT

Liz tweeted a rad Infragram of Brooklyn (above) that deserved some post processing. So here are some fun versions. Should there be a gallery for such images? There is an official Infragram-media wiki, but maybe there should be a less official place to share Infragrams.

<p></p><em>False color infrared or NBG. Near infrared is displayed as red, blue as green, and green as blue.</em>

<p></p><em>Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This one has a weird and biologically inappropriate color table applied to it (_5_ramps.lut), but it looks cool, just like Brooklyn.</em>

<p></p><em>The x-ray version. This is grayscale NDVI.</em>

These images were made using Ned's Fiji plugin and also Photoshop.
