# LEAFFEST Fungal Fun

###LEAFFEST
####Learning Everything About Fungal Foraging Especially Sautéing Techniques

Sunday morning mushroom foraging at LEAFFEST yielded about 20 species of spore bearing bodies. This included what was probably the deadly poisonous destroying angel (*Amanita virosa*) and lots of small species. Most of the mass of what we found and collected was *Hydnum repandum*, an edible and delicious "hedgehog" mushroom. These were in prime condition and were quickly sautéed and consumed, but not before capturing Infragrams and other photos of them.
