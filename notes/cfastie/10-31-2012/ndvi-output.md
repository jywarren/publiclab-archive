# NDVI output

<em>Three new color tables made by Ned Horning to present NDVI values as color images.</em>

Ned Horning has been working on his ImageJ plugin and since I finished my poster and my last research note, he made improvements to the way it standardizes images so they have a similar appearance. Below is an updated composite of the New Hampshire cover crop trials made with new options in the plugin. I aligned 20 new NDVI images in Photoshop, but the images output by the plugin were not adjusted or blended. I will bring a copy of this to Cocodrie to add to the unposter session.
