# Great Video from Northeastern University about Kaya Simmons and his work with Public Lab 

Kaya is working on low cost [thermal imaging](http://publiclab.org/notes/kaya9804/3-31-2013/thermal-fishing-bob-research-note-331), he's aiming to test out a version of the fishing bob this fall around the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Plant in collaboration with Cape Cod Bay Watch.  He received a [small research grant](http://publiclab.org/notes/kaya9804/2-12-2013/research-plan) from Northeastern University as a Freshman to develop the project based on the work of [Eymund Deigel, student work at RISD with Jeff Warren](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/thermal-fishing-bob/).  In this video he describes the relevance of Public Lab's approaches to his neighborhood in Brooklyn where Liz Barry and Gowanus Canal Conservancy are doing pioneering work integrating balloon mapping and other Public Lab tools with local advocacy efforts to clean up the Gowanus Superfund site.

It is so exciting for me as co-founder of Public Lab who works primarily in the Social Sciences to see such applied, community oriented work welcomed and celebrated within Sociology at an undergraduate level!
