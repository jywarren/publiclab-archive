# Map of New Mexico Natural Gas Wells in New Mexico and levels of Hydrogen Sulfide

This maps shows gas wells in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico that have recorded levels of hydrogen sulfide between 10ppm to over 100 ppm.  The map was made by the Bureau of Land Managment. It is useful for planning both our lab and field experiments in communities to document H2S exposure.
