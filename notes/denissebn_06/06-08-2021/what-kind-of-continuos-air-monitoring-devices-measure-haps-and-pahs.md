# What kind of continous air monitoring devices measure HAPs and PAHs?

This question was asked to Public Lab staff by a community organizer in Oregon. Thanks for any insights you're able to offer! 

What kind of continuous\* air quality monitoring devices measure HAPs (benzene, naphthalene, etc) and PAHs? 

\*HAPs = Hazardous Air Pollutants

\*PAHs = Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
