# How subsurface gasses migrate and what allows them to dissipate? Landfill gasses

As a community air monitor, we want to know more about subsurface gasses and their interaction with atmospheric pressure. Specially landfill gasses. 

  
This question came out of a conversation with the Fellowship Team located in Val Verde, California, USA. Interested in learning more about their air quality monitoring project and following their progress? Follow us here: [VVAMP](https://publiclab.org/wiki/vvamp "https://publiclab.org/wiki/vvamp")
