# Using Photosynth to automatically stitch images from kite-mapping

###What I wanted to do

I want to easily stitch together images taken during kite mapping.

###My attempt and results

I used Microsoft's Photosynth.  See https://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=e623beae-5692-4fe1-aa03-0aea2b27f50a for the automatically generated result produced from 34 images generated during a kite mapping run.  Photosynth seems to have correctly placed all 34 images without human input.

The result can be shared with Microsoft's Bing maps if desired.

###Questions and next steps

Photosynth also allows geotagging of a resulting image, orienting it relative to Microsoft Bing maps.  I do not yet know how to use this feature proficiently.

I do not know whether it is possible to export the results to formats other than Photosynth's internal format.

###Why I'm interested

I'm interested as the use of automatic image stitching routines seems to allow considerable time savings.

###Related work

Photosynth is mentioned in http://www.publiclab.org/notes/mathew/02-25-2014/3d-data-from-image-sets-autostitching

###Thanks

I am grateful to Cindy Regalado and Ted Fjallman for introducing us so enjoyably to kite mapping.
