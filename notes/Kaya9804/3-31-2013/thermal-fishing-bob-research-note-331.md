# Thermal Fishing Bob Research Note 3/31

Hey Guys,

Here are some photos  of our experimentation so far.  Everything seems to be going great so far except for two things:
-The LED light does not respond correctly to temperature change because we don't know how to preset the values for each color in in the ardiuno sketch.
- The serial monitor also does not give second by second readings.  Instead it consistently just exports 0.00 degrees.

Any help will be greatly appreciated! The link to the ardiuno code and sketch were are using are here http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/thermal-fishing-bob/
