# Aerial Mapping Projects in Environmental Science at The Thacher School

# Aerial Mapping Unit with a High School Class

Students in the AP Environmental Science class at the Thacher School are embarking on aerial mapping projects, to answer questions of interest to this small, rural, boarding school community. We will post stories about our findings here, and welcome feedback and suggestions from the community.
