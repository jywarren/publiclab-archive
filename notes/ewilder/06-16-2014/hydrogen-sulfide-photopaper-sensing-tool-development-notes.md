# Hydrogen Sulfide Photopaper Sensing Tool - Development Notes

The purpose of this research was to test whether the photopaper sensing tool can be used to map hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emissions around sites of oil and gas extraction.

A general description of the tool and instructions for using it can be found [here](http://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-sensing).

The presentation available below describes the process of creating the final maps for our first site, in Deaver, WY. In the interest of improving the process next time, it highlights the challenges and problems that we encountered during each stage of the process.
