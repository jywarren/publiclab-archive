# Can Public Lab's Lego Spectrometer be used to measure sunscreen in water?

Our group would like to measure the amount of sunscreen, and potentially other hygiene products, in water. I know the Lego Spectrometer has been used for oil, but does anyone have experience using it for substances like sunscreen? If so, please send us some tips!
