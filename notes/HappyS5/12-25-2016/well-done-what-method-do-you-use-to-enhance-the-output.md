# Well done. What method do you use to enhance the output? 

Hello, 

I am interested in finding an analytical method that will help me detect household chemicals to river pollutants. 

Often, methods are designed to get the most out of  Raman spectroscopy[1]. What method do you think would work best with your DIY? 

**Quote: **"Raman  signal  is  normally  quite  weak  and  people  are  constantly  improving  Raman  spectroscopy  techniques. Many different ways of sample preparation, sample illumination or scattered light detection were invented to enhance intensityof Raman signal. Here we will examine some of them."
