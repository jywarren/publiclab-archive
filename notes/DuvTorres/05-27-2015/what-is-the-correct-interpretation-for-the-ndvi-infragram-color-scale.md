# What is the correct interpretation for the NDVI infragram color scale?

Hi, 
Now I’m working in some tests with aerial crop images for NDVI calculating, however I have had some problems for interpretation of infragram results. 
I don´t understand the color scale used by the software, because theorically the higher NDVI have to show red color (good chlorophylla levels), and near zero have to be Green (soil), but I got different results in each image I have processed, 
I need your help to can understand this values or to stablish a correct scale that let an adjusted interpretation for determine health of crops.  

Thanks!
