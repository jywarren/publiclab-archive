# How can I create and work on my own issue in Github? 

I have a few features I'd like to make to my recent work on the stats page, as well as seeing if I can implement a bridge between Github and the Public Lab Q&A system.  Both of them have been discussed informally with positive feedback.    

  
My questions are:

  
1) Given that the process will need to be kept track of am I correct in thinking it should be filed as an issue?

  
2) What process of "consensus" should I engage with/set up to confirm/shape these ideas such that they would receive support, PR review, and eventually merged?  For example, are there @mentions that I should make sure to use?  Would mentioning it in a weekly check-in be the right place?  

  
3) Anything else I should think of before taking on such an endeavor?
