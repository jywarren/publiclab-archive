# Is there a simple and reliable way to test the rigidity of the spectrometer?

###What I want to do or know

What situations can I deploy the spectrometer in and how long can I use it under various conditions?

What should I expect when traveling with it?  Suppose I put it in my bag in a cardboard box to protect it; should I place packing material around spec or will the box be enough?

Can I quickly move it from one place to another or does it require special handling even when I do nothing more than rearrange my setup on the table?  

What happens to it if it gets wet?  When (if) it dries will it retain it's former rigidity?  

What if it gets accidentally crushed?  Can I prop it back up again, or are the perfect 90 degree angles essential to its functioning?
