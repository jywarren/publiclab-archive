# Water Samples Group 7 

See a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8v23EBZoS8&feature=youtu.be) of the conductivity of our samples! 

Looking back at our predictions of each sample's conductivity, it was interesting to find that we were wrong about one. Surprisingly, sample 3 from Jamaica Pond had the highest conductivity of the three samples. I (Jenn) thought that it might have a low conductivity because of how clear and cleaned it appeared. But clearly, I was wrong. The lowest conductivity was found in sample 2 from Copley as predicted. Overall it was telling to see why each sample had their different conductivities because of how they're taken care of.
