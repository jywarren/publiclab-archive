# Do the same regulations that apply to drones apply to balloon mapping?

Just wondering if I want to get aerial photography within 5 miles of an airport if there are height restrictions or things like that for balloon mapping - or if the no fly zones for drones within 5 miles of an airport apply to balloon mapping as well.
