# Size of aerial imagery from balloons and kites

Does anyone out there know how much area is covered by images that are taken from a balloon or kite? I know that the area will be different depending on high you are flying, but if anyone knows sizes at different altitudes, I would love to have that information. 

I am planning a citizen science project in the Linville Gorge, NC to map the gorge's invasive species and target them for removal and treatment and I am trying to plan how many locations we will need to visit to map the whole gorge.
