# are real-time PM 2.5 push warnings from the PurpleAir possible?

hi there. i have been having mysterious PM 2.5 spikes on my Purple Air several times a day (usually from ~12 ug/m3 to 100 ug/m3!!). i recently figured out what is causing it: i live by a charcoal burger place that sends smoke throughout my neighborhood when they relight their grill at peak hours. it is what it is unfortunately, until these restaurants get properly regulated. 

  
but i like to work in my yard, and id love to be able to just put on an N95 when a charcoal smoke event is happening. but i can't sit refreshing purple air all day either -- and the episodes tend to last about 20 minutes.

  
is there any software that would allow me to monitor raw PM 2.5 levels from the PurpleAir in real-time, and send a push notification when they exceed a certain threshold?

  
i feel like this type of dynamic background monitoring using the PurpleAir would be useful for other people too!
