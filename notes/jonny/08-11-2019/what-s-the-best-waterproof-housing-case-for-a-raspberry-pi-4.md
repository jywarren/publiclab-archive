# What's the best waterproof housing/case for a Raspberry Pi 4?

I'm working on a public sculpture installation with Raspberry Pi nodes that connect to sensors via bluetooth. I'm looking for a combination of affordability and durability for a case/housing that will stand up to being installed outside, exposed to the elements in Norwalk, Ct. Any recommendations?
