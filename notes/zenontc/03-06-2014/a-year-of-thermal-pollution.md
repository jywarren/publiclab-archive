# A Year of Thermal Pollution from Oyster Creek Nuclear Plant

Jeff asked me to share this as a reference for thermal pollution mapping. It's an animation I made several years ago of thermal pollution from Oyster Creek Nuclear Plant in New Jersey. I went through a similar discovery process as [Don](http://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/02-23-2014/preliminary-plymouth-plant-plume-ponderings) -- and actually did the calculation where I was able to measure temperature by pixel -- but for the purpose of the clarity I chose to simplify the visualization to above ambient water temperature. Enjoy!

The following animation presents a series of thermal infrared LANDSAT images that visualize what a year of thermal pollution from Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station looks like. The pink represents temperatures above ambient levels. The imagery was provided by the Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis at Rutgers University, and was produced by the Environmental Health Clinic.
