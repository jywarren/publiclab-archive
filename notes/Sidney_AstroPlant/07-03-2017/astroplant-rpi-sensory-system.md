# AstroPlant RPi sensory system

â€‹Dear community members,

I am currently involved in the development of a hydroponics prototype kit for assessing plant growth in the Netherlands. It is an open science initiative in collaboration with ESA aimed to measure optimum environmental conditions for plants. Hereby we use a Raspberry Pi to measure all kinds of environmental data with the kit. I have a couple of challenges:

---------

- I'm new to the field of hyperspectral imaging and found the InfraGram
initiative very exciting. I use a Pi Noir camera with a blue filter,
however I haven't managed to get the desired images that allow for
assessing photosynthesis in plants. Is there anyone working with the Rpi
Noir camera? Preferably I would like to read into some documentation if
available or a contact person to discuss further details. In our case
we have a controlled environment and can construct a specific background
if needed for optimum pictures. Below a picture taken with the RPi Noir camera (taken outside of the kit):

- We would like to have water quality testing such as Electrical Conductivity, PH mainly. Most Raspberry Pi interface-capable sensors are very expensive, and we are looking for cost-effective solutions.

Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,
Sidney (on behalf of AstroPlant)
