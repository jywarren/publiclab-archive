# Spectrometer from a drone

###Hi guys and congrats on this project, it's amazing! I'd like to know if it would be possible to take imagery from a drone using your spectrometer with a high quality cam? 

###I'm a marine biologist and we use a (very) expensive hyperspectral sensor on-board an aircraft to get some images from lagoon etc. From the reflectance spectrum, we can identify the habitat (sand, algae, type of corals etc.). I'd like to equip a drone with a spectrometer to collect images along predefined tracks. I was wondering if this would be feasible using this spectrometer. As it's for marine applications, we don't need wavelengths higher than the red (absorbed in the first mm). To make it short:
- Can we use the spectrometer for outdoors applications?
- If so, is it possible to select the wavelengths to scan?
- From the wiki, I understand that you can take 20-30 samples per second so if I scan from 390 to 600 nm with a 3 nm step, it means that it would take about 4 sec to get an image?

Thanks!
