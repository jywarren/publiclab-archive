# Use Your Sensors: Oil Water Testing Event in New Orleans!

## Event details

The Public Lab Oil and Gas Water Fellowship Trio will host an event on Tuesday, November 19 from 6-8pm at Global Green! We'll test [Arduino + DF Robot turbidity sensors](https://publiclab.org/notes/wmacfarl/10-12-2019/testing-of-df-robot-turbidity-sensor), and consider how they could be used for oil and gas water monitoring. We'll use this prompt as a way to generally discuss best techniques for water monitoring (grab samples, etc), tools available for water monitoring, and what water quality information can tell us about oil and gas activity. Join us if you'd like to learn more about DIY water monitoring of all sorts, but especially taking field samples and testing for evidence of oil & gas impacts. **Come with a curious mind and a water sample from a location near you!**

**Who:** This is a public, free event. Recommended for adults and teens, but all welcome.

**Food:** Dinner will be served.

**Location:** Global Green, 5400 Douglas Street, New Orleans, LA 70117

**Time:** Tuesday, November 19, 6pm-8pm CT

**Accessibility:** Global Green is reachable by car (plenty of street parking), and is a 10-minute walk from the 88 bus line. The building is handicap accessible. If you would like to attend this event and have concerns about accessibility needs, please shoot an email to [charlotte@lowernine.org](mailto:charlotte@lowernine.org) and we'll do our best to accommodate you.
