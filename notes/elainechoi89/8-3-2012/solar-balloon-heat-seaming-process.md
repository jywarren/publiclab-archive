# Solar Balloon Heat Seaming Process

Heat Seaming Process:
Two layers of painters plastic on top of each other with about 1 inch seam. Create a thin line of heat by tilting the hot iron on an angle (on its side). A parchment paper is necessary, functions like a buffer so that the plastic does not get over heated and tear. Utilizing a ruler or a guide helps to create a straighter heat seam.
