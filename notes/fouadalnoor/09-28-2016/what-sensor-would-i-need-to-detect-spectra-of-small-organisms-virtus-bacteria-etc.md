# What sensor would I need to detect spectra of small organisms (virtus, bacteria etc)

###What I want to do or know
What CCD sensor (or other sensor?) that could be used to detect the spectra of very small organisms such as bacteria or viruses?
###Background story

I'm trying to set up a cheap experiment to look at the transmission spectrum of viruses or bacteria, but not sure which sensor would be useful for this purpose? Since you guys have a DIY kit available, I thought you might know. 

Thanks in advance!

Fouad.
