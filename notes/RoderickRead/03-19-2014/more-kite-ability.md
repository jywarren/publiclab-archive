# More kite ability

I'd like to share research in kite functionality. 

My plans for a [steered single line kite](http://www.instructables.com/id/Remote-steer-a-single-line-lifter-kite/)... Using a remote control to adjust bridle tensions. This will allow your camera to be over to the side of the wind window not just directly downwind. Where you frame your picture from can give access to better pictures and much more data.

I recommend a good steady lifter sled and drogue kite for KAP.

The next rig I'm designing for will be a long term lifter. Using [arch kites weather-cocking on a ground rail](http://youtu.be/FAmSKF7wu0c) can provide steady lift in the most diverse wind conditions.

There is still a long way to go to make these Airborne Wind Energy Systems fully accessible and open source.
But research has started and we're quite convinced of a coming aero-architecture language to describe lifting and generating structures.
