# Fort Bayou Near Infrared Map

Yesterday (9/10/14), a group of Wash U students, with Stevie and Scott from Public Lab, went out near Fort Bayou. We balloon mapped the vegetation in the area near the terraces -- using a near infrared camera. We stitched together some of the images we collected (see main image) using Map Knitter, but ran into an issue on Infragram.org converting the stitched image to NDVI. Has anyone attempted to convert a stitched image to NDVI before or is it best to convert the images before stitching?
