# Learning How to Control Arduino with Raspberry Pi

I have not updated in awhile, but I am going to be updating on everything I have been doing the past weeks in the coming days. We learned how to use the Arduino Kit with a couple of learning modules. We first learned how to control the LEDs on the Arduino itself, then moved over to a breadboard to learn how to connect an LED to and have it blink when prompted. Lastly, we then learned about the serial and analog pins on the board and ended with doing some serial connections with a potentiometer.
