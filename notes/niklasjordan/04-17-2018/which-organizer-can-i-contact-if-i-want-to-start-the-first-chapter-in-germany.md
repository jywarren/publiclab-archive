# Which organizer can I contact if I want to start the first chapter in Germany?

On the wiki page for "Start a chapter" it says that I should contact an organizer near me:  
  

> Take a look through places, regions, and lists to see if there is activity in your area of interestFinally, email the organizers to let them know you are interested in starting a chapter.

However, there is no organizer in my country yet, because there is no chapter in Germany. Therefore I would like to start the first chapter in Germany with some friends. Who can I contact about this?
