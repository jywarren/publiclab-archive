# Has anyone experienced measuring and analyzing microplastics?

How did you proceed, which system did you use? Somebody use the [LADI trawler][1] or are there better alternatives?

We want to determine and monitor how much microplasty is in our local lakes.

I am grateful for all the tips and experiences you share with me.
