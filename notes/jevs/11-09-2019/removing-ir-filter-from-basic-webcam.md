# Removing IR filter from basic webcam?

I bought a basic webcam like the one shown in the kit. Took it apart. Pulled what I thought might be the IR glass off the sensor. I knew it was a risk, but I got the glass off the sensor, but must have broke it also. 

Does the basic webcam like shown in the kit even have an IR filter you can remove?

Just from watching various videos and looking at web pages, I thought you need to remove an IR filter from these. I thought the glass actually stuck to the sensor might be it, but it does not seem you can remove that without breaking the sensor. I am also not sure if that is an IR filter or not?

  
If not, is there a cheap webcam that does have a filter you can remove?
