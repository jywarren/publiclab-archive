# Problem with rotating the image

Hi
I am trying to rotate the image on the map  But the menu to rotate does not appear on the picture.  The four corners of the picture is iconed with the circles and allow me to stretch.  I cannot rotate or do any other thing.

Can you please help me.

Regards
De Silva
