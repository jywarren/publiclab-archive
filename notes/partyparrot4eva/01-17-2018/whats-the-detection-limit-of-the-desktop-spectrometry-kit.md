# Whats the detection limit of the Desktop Spectrometry kit?

Hello,

  
I'm interested in trying the Spectrometry on various foods and other objects items in my home.

I can't find any articles where someone has estimated the detection limit.

For example the FDA maximum limit for Mercury is 1 ppm.

Would I be able to detect this?
