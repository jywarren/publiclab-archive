# Use this research to build inexpensive autonomous lionfish killing drones

###What I want to do or know
People interested in this buoyancy control device project may be interested in the Facebook group "LionTamer" where we discuss using inexpensive buoyancy controlled autonomous drones to hunt and kill lionfish.

I've posted the link to this project on the groups page. Thanks!
