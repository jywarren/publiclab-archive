# What strategies have been implemented to use citizen science successfully in litigation?

Citizens can use litigation to hold accountable polluters and others whose actions adversely impact the environment. These actions can include wastewater treatment plants discharging sewage into public waters, factories or cars emitting harmful air contaminants that make residents sick, or industrial facilities improperly disposing of their solid wastes.

  
I found this helpful [link](https://citizenscienceguide.com/supplement-2-using-citizen-science-data-litigation), which emphasizes, "Citizen science can play an important role in citizen environmental enforcement by producing evidence for use in litigation. Evidence includes, but is not limited to, eyewitness testimony, photographs, videos, and sampling data. "

  
Does anyone have examples of successfully entering evidence in a legal realm?
