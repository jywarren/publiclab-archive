# The Roomba Project

Environmental Justice Research Cluster uses a Roomba as a medium in order to reveal the condition of our surroundings. Especially, we use MQ 135, an air quality sensor to express the condition of air. In the future, we can also use the wireless system or hack a roomba to control its movement as the quality of air.
