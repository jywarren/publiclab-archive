# Run infragram offiline (whitout online analysis)

Hello! 

First, let me show the results of my first test with the old webcan (generic webcan with 5mp).  I'am live in Brazil and here is not easy to get good filters. But this is my modest result (from the window my house..):![image description](/i/46778.png "cam_teste_001.png")

  
My question: somebody can recommend the python library to work with the NDVI and colorsmap? My idead is work in offline mode embedded in the raspberry pi computer.  
  
Muito Obrigado!  
Abra√ßos.  
Eduardo
