# What water quality data can we collect to investigate oil/gas pollution?

More context for this question is here: [https://publiclab.org/notes/wmacfarl/09-18-2019/oil-and-gas-hardware-fellow-introduction](https://publiclab.org/notes/wmacfarl/09-18-2019/oil-and-gas-hardware-fellow-introduction)

Briefly: I am thinking about tool and project development for water quality monitoring around oil and gas pollution. In order to develop useful data-collection tools we need to know what kinds of things people want to use data for.

There are lots of sensors and lots of water-quality indicators that people and organizations monitor.  Which ones are correlated with oil and gas industry related contamination?

From [An Introduction to Community Based Water Monitoring](https://www.fractracker.org/projects/water-monitor/intro/) --

"Groups trained by ALLARM and other service providers typically monitor conductivity, temperature, water depth, and the presence of radionuclides associated with shale formations such as barium and strontium. These core indicators are basic signatures of changes in water quality. But other groups also monitor for pH, dissolved oxygen, metals, chlorides and many other parameters that might point to specific causes of watershed impacts."
