# Oil and Gas Hardware Fellow Status Update: Week 11

These last couple of weeks have been difficult and busy for personal reasons so I haven't had as much of a chance to work on oil+gas+water-related projects as I would like.  

We are nearing the end of the fellowship period, so it's time for us to really start synthesizing our work and resources and collecting questions, documentation, and curated resources.  While I expect we will all continue to work on and think about these issues after the fellowship period is over, we want to make sure that our work is well-documented, accessible, and extensible so that other community members and researchers can build off of it.

For me, this is two things:

- Putting together the template for our [Oil+Gas+Water research area review][1]
- Documenting the process of using the [simple water sensor kit][2] design with different kinds of sensors ([pH sensor build documentation is here])[3]
- Rewriting Arduino software to make it easier for people to switch between and calibrate sensors
- Collecting resources and stories about the use and calibration of these kinds of liquid sensors
