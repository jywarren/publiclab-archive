# Connecting Pi camera to Raspberry Pi

For the LEGO spectrometer kit is there an adapter needed to connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi? The ribbon coming from the camera is too wide to fit in R-Pi and the cable that comes with the R-Pi which seems like it would do the job is 40mm so no way it's going to work.
