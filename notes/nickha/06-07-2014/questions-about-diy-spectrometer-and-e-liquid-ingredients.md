# Questions about DIY spectrometer and e-liquid ingredients

###What I want to do
I would like to know if the DIY spectrometer is capable of giving me an idea of ingredients in a sample of e-liquid (used in e-cigarettes).

###My attempt and results
I've constructed the foldable spectrometer and I have tried to calibrate it.  However, I'm not sure if I'm getting an accurate read out.  I've been using it on my Samsung Galaxy S3.  The problem seems to be the orientation of the bands and light leaking into the chamber.

###Questions and next steps
I want to know more about the ingredients of this particular e-liquid.  There are a lot of overlapping compounds in the flavoring extracts but I feel that if I could determine if certain ingredients were present that I could eliminate or confirm possible options.

###Why I'm interested
I find analysis of this nature fascinating.  Also, the particular e-liquid I am interested in is notoriously difficult to obtain.  I have reverse engineered one of the flavors from the same vendor but this one is much more complex.  I simply want to be able to make this substance and not deal with the perils of trying to find it.

On a side note, I am a software engineer and I would open to looking at the spectral workbench software if there is something I can help with.  Like many disciplines, software has many sub categories so if there is something I'm knowledgeable about which needs some help I would be willing.
