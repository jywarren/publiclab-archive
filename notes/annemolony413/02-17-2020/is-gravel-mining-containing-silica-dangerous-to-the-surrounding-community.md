# Is gravel mining containing silica dangerous to the surrounding community?

The area being mined contains white silica identified by a geologist. The mine is close to a community who are concerned for their health, water ways and tank water. Do they have reasons to be concerned?  This gravel mine plans to extend to incorporate fifty hectares of white gravel hills.
