# How do I take root and hypocotyl pictures for plant without light influence

Hi, guys. I am working on a project to study plant roots and hypocotyl. And i need take pictures for them in dark room. I do not want use lights that plants can use, like visible lights. I checked some articles and found that near infrared light might useful for me. Currently, i have a pi camera V2\. Is it possible for me to buy near infrared light resource and also change my pi camera to capture near infrared light? Great thanks for your help.
