# How can I identify bits of plastic from the beach in an image?

A friend at Greenpeace asked me if there's a way to automate counting micro-plastic particles from beach surveys.

I played around a bit with the Image Sequencer, but it wonder if there's a relatively simple filter I can apply to the RGB channels to find edges, without having to predefine the colors I want to extract.

I attached an example image, which could also be on a dark background if that would help with the lighter pieces. Once we have a good filtering process, we'd want to build a simple webapp to let people take photos and do counts themselves.
