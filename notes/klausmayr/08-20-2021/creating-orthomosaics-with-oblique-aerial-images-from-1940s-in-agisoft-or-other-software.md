# Creating orthomosaics with oblique aerial images from 1940s in Agisoft or other software?

I've got some oblique aerial images that were taken in 1941 and I would like to make an orthomosaic with them. I've done this with vertical (nadir) aerial images before, but not with obliques. Does anyone have any experience with this?
