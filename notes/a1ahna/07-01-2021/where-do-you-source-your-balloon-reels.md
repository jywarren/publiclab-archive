# Where do you source your balloon reels?

Hey y'all!  We're having some difficulty sourcing kite reels seeing as Shanti Kites is temporarily closed.  Does anyone have suggestions on alternative sources where I can buy pre-wound reels with 1,000 feet of 110# Dacron line on a 8 inch hoop winder, or something similar?  Tagging in all of my brilliant kits predecessors for help!  @cfastie @eustatic @patcoyle @matthew @bronwen @warren
