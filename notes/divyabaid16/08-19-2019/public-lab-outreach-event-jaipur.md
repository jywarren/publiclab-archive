# Public Lab Outreach Event - Jaipur

Today, 19th August 2019 I, with few of my batch mates, organized GSoC meetup event in our University in order to help, guide and bring more developers to the open-source environment.

We demonstrated how to use Git, Github and the power of the Version Control System. We tried to elaborate on the importance of the community like Public Lab and how it helps to tackle the environmental concerns.

This was the first time I interacted with such a large group of students, I was a bit nervous but as the talk went on I started feeling more comfortable and I regained my confidence. Delivering such a talk and interacting with students not only provide the information but also boosts one's confidence and improves public speaking skills.

I practically tried to show them the first-timers-only issues of the plots2, showed them the template of FTOs. Elaborated on how to proceed with them.

Below are some of the points on which my talk focused :

- What is Open Source? What is Github? Git Vs Github.
- Open Source Vs Closed Source.
- Deep dive on Version Control System.
- How to get started? I told the story of my first contribution.
- What is the Public Lab? What is GSoC? How to get involved with Public Lab?
- What are FTOs, the importance of FTOs in Public Lab? How the Public Lab is newcomer friendly.
- Practical demonstration on how to report a bug, open an issue, claim an issue and other ways to contribute.
