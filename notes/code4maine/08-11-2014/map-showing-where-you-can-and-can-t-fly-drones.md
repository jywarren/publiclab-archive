# Map showing where you can and can't fly drones

The following map can be found at https://www.mapbox.com/drone/no-fly/ and additional data can be added via its Github page-
https://github.com/mapbox/drone-feedback.  This has already proven useful for my own projects as I my own project area is heavily restricted.  Does anybody know if the same restrictions apply to KAP or Balloon Mapping?
