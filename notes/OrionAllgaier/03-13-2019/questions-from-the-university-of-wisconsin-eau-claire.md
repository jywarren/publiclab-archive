# Questions about Plantower sensors from the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire

Hi All,

This seems to be a very promising development towards affordable particulate counters as well as understanding their basic function and analysis. Regarding these "Simple Air Sensors", I am curious...

1\. In the Plantower manual (for the PurpleAir monitor), we haven't been able to find the conversion between # of particles per liter to micrograms per liter. This conversion includes assumed particle density \[e.g., "Arizona Road Dust" of 2.65 g/mL\] and average volume per particle for each of the size ranges measured. Does anyone have this information?

2\. Is the sensor interpreting results using Rayleigh, Mie, or some other combination of scattering?

Thank you,
