# What are observable signs of improper reclamation practices at or around mining sites?

[This National Wildlife Federation article](https://indexarticles.com/reference/national-wildlife/cracking-down-on-mining-pollution/) mentions "shoot and shove" at coal mines, a practice where mine operators simply "pushed leftover rock and dirt over the mountainside." What other examples are there that people might be able to observe?
