# Is there federal-level recourse that communities can take when mine reclamation is not being done properly?

From the research area review kick-off call on mine reclamation ([call notes here](http://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall)), a common theme was that state or county agencies were not doing enough to ensure proper reclamation by mining companies. There are regulatory loopholes and lack of enforcement on granted permits.    

Are there federal laws, regulations, or programs that could help in these cases? Thanks for any ideas!
