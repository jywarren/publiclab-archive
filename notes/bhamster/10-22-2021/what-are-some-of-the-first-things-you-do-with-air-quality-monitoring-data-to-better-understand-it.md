# What are some of the first things you do with air quality monitoring data to better understand it? 

As part of the current [research area review on air quality data](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/10-18-2021/delving-into-air-quality-data-for-our-next-research-area-review), we're gathering information on steps leading up to creating data visualizations.

These first data analysis and visualization steps will vary depending on what kind of air quality data someone has and how it was collected. For instance, real-time data collected continuously from a stationary air sensor versus intermittent data from a hand-held monitor that was used in different locations at different times.

Any tips that people can share about their first steps related to data analysis and visualization would be greatly appreciated!
