# What are examples of air quality data visualizations that don’t require coding or computationally intensive computer graphics?

Many of the air quality data visualizations I see online feature graphics that are beautiful and also seem to require some knowledge of computer coding for analysis and creating the graphics.   

What other approaches are there to creating impactful air quality data visualizations? What examples have people here seen?
