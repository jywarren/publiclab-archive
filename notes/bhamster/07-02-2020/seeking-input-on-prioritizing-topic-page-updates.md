# Seeking input on prioritizing Topic page updates

Hello community members!

As part of my role at Public Lab, I'll be helping to review and update our Topics pages so that they are as current, comprehensive, and useful as possible to the community. I would love to collaborate on this process and in choosing which Topics (a.k.a. Research Areas) to prioritize. If you'd like to join, please read on!

I'll be building on previous thinking on Research Area Reviews (captured [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/05-23-2019/thinking-through-research-area-reviews), [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/05-24-2019/idea-to-distribute-tasks-for-a-reserach-area-review?), and [here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/reviews)). The first collaborative task is to **choose four Topics to focus attention on **for the rest of the year. Check out the list of Topics currently featured on Public Lab [here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/topics).

# Question

What would you find helpful or effective in a collaborative process for choosing Topics? An open call where we all convene at one time? A page calling for votes on Topics, where you can add thoughts at any time? Both? Any specific approaches or practices to use/avoid?

I'd appreciate any thoughts, ideas, or questions on this! Please comment below to share.

Also, stay tuned for more information on an upcoming community event, hopefully in August, where we can continue the conversation.
