# What are ways to alert residents to air quality concerns without using cell phones or wifi?

We're interested in approaches that could apply in situations where affected residents might not have continuous access to cell phones or wifi.  

This is a complementary question to conversations about how to use text notifications to communicate air quality data ([example here](https://publiclab.org/questions/purpleairfan/10-04-2021/are-real-time-pm-2-5-push-warnings-from-the-purpleair-possible)).   

Thank you for any ideas or examples!
