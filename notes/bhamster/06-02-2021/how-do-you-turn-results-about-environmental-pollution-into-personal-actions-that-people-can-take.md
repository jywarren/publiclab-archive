# How do you turn results about environmental pollution into personal actions that people can take?

This is another question that's come up a couple times during our recent Open Calls ([notes here](http://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall)) on organizing and advocacy. It's related to [this question on making environmental monitoring data meaningful to people](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/06-02-2021/how-do-you-make-results-from-environmental-monitoring-personally-meaningful-to-people).

**How do you translate environmental data into doable actions that people can take to minimize personal harm?**
