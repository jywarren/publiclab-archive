What: a time to welcome each other to the topic and share stories, highlights in research and advocacy, and ideas for what to do next.

This is another installment of Public Lab's virtual get-togethers around an environmental topic, this time on [air quality](https://publiclab.org/wiki/air-quality). We'll be gathering to share highlights from the current [research area review on air quality](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/10-20-2020/research-area-review-on-air-quality) and to help people get started in community air monitoring.
<br>

## Who is this event for?

**Anyone who's interested in air quality monitoring**, especially those looking for a supportive community as they start local investigations into their air.

Marking the 50th anniversary of the Clean Air Act in the US, we'll be spending the month of December focusing on air quality. Are you going to attend Public Lab's December OpenHour, "[Take Back Your Air: Using the Bucket Air Quality Monitor](https://publiclab.org/openhour#December+9,+2020,+12:00+ET,+Take+Back+Your+Air:+Using+the+Bucket+Air+Quality+Monitor)"? Come join this research area review event a week later to share your follow-up questions, stories, or project ideas.

Not going to attend the OpenHour but still interested in air quality? Join us to talk about accessible ways to research air pollution in your community, including using tools like the [Bucket monitor](https://publiclab.org/wiki/bucket-monitor) and the [Simple Air Sensor](https://publiclab.org/wiki/simple-air-sensor).

This research area review event, the [OpenHour](https://publiclab.org/openhour), and weekly [Open Calls](https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call) in December will all offer opportunities for us to connect, share, and plan to take action for healthier air.
