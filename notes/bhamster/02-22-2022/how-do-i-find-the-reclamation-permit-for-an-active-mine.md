# How do I find the reclamation permit for an active mine?

In the US, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act requires mining companies to obtain permits that include plans for how they will reclaim the mined land.   

Are there common places where permits might be publicly available for viewing or available for request? Thanks!
