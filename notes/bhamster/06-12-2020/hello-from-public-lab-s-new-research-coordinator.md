# Hello from Public Lab's new Research Coordinator

Hello Public Lab community!

My name is Jeanette and I recently joined the Public Lab non-profit team as the Research Coordinator. I'm excited for the opportunity to meet, learn from, and work together with you all in this community.

Before coming to Public Lab, I spent time researching and writing about hagfish slime, lobster swimming, and robot fish. Over time I realized that my favorite part of science is sharing it. So, I'm here at Public Lab to help update and expand topics pages, connect with new community members, and support you all in this work.

Thanks for reading, and please leave a comment if you have any questions or would like to say 'hello'!
