# Is this government security warning on NOAA new?

###Is this warning on a NOAA arctic data page search new? 
Also, is this an attempt to copyright a database, and what is going on?


###Looking for information on the Arctic

This afternoon I went to the NOAA site, and was greeted by this page, requiring sign-in with a lot of other intimidating stuff. I'm wondering about the basis for these claims regarding data from a public agency.

Arctic data from the Earth Observatory Laboratory site has none of the warnings on the noaa page, rather, simple FTP links to data sets.
