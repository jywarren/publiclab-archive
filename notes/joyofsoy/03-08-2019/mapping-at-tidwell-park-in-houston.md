# Mapping at Tidwell Park in Houston

Sunday at the Barnraising we went to Tidwell Park in Houston. The park is right by the community center and has active baseball and soccer fields, basketball courts, a playground, and a nature trail that runs alongside Halls Bayou. We spent some time balloon mapping, then a group went to do some soil testing along the banks of the bayou. Post on that soon to come!
