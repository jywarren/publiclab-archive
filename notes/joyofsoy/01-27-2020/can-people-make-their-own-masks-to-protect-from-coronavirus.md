# Can people make their own masks to protect from coronavirus?

This question was submitted via email by a community partner:

People in Hong Kong can't get respirators or masks for the coronavirus and we cannot ship to our family and friends there either. Is it possible to make your own masks out of other materials? Thank you for your help!
