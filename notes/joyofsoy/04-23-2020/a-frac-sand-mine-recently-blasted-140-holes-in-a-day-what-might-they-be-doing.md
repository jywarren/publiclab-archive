# A frac sand mine recently blasted 140 holes in a day. What might they be doing?

A frac sand mine in western Wisconsin recently blasted 140 holes in one day in one section of their 80-acre property, according to a local community group. Not having any more details, is there any way to guess what they might be doing? Are they looking for a vein? 

The mine operated as a gravel quarry for decades, but I believe converted to selling to the frac sand industry last year, with all sand processing being done offsite.
