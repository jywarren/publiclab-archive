#  Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI)

Does anyone have an opinion on using the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) for analyzing agricultural plant health?  This can use a standard RGB camera.  Obviously not NDVI but comparing "greeness" can be a plus.  What software is available to calculate this from an image?

I would like to use a quadcopter with the standard (RGB) camera to capture field images and compare the relative "greenness" to be able to quickly see variation in a field.
