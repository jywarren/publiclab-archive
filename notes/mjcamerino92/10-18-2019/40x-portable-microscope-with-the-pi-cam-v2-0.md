# 40x portable microscope with the pi cam V2.0

I am interested in designing a 40x portable microscope with the pi cam V2.0\. I was wondering what kind of micron per pixel, and working distance you are achieving. Do you have any parts list for this configuration and sample images (H and E staining showing cellularity would be great) you have taken with your system?  
Best,
