# Barataria Low Altitude Balloon Mapping

###What I want to do
Documentation of Barataria area of Mississippi River delta south of New Orleans, Louisiana.
###My attempt and results
Balloon mapping along the coast in Barataria for updated gulf-coast mapping.
###Questions and next steps
Continuation of documentation along the coast.
###Why I'm interested
The disappearance of the gulf-coast happens at an alarming rate and as a result of multiple human infrastructural interferences.  Through balloon mapping, we can bypass expensive and bureaucratic options and disseminate the disappearance of the gulf for research and public understanding.
