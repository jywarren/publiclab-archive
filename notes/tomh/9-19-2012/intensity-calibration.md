# intensity calibration

Is there a way to use the "spectralworkbench" to calibrate spectrometers for intensity variations across the accessible spectral range.  In more detail; the sensitivities of the RGB pixels  on a webcam are adjusted so that the resultant image matches what a person sees; the eye is most sensitive in the green with falloff at higher and lower wavelengths.  Ideally a spectrometer should be equally sensitive to all wavelengths, and it should be possible to develop a calibration method that adjusts the spectral intensities from what the webcam delivers to a more uniform wavelength vs. sensitivity profile.  

Is there already a way to do this with "spectralworkbench" or is there someone who knows how to do this?
