# Creating Multispectral Imagery for California Beaches

Over the last few weeks, I've been working on streamlining a workflow to stitch together photos taken from my hot air balloon near Santa Barbara, CA (one set is standard color photos and the other is infrared) into one image with four colors (red, green, blue, and IR).  Pictured here are some preliminary results - a false color infrared image of the dunes.  Some details need to be worked out, such as why the images lose so much resolution in the stitching process, but that will come with a little more work.  I've used a combination of Hugin, Quantum GIS, and GDAL to make this image.
