# Occupy UC Davis - Nov. 21, 2011

Students, faculty, alumni, and the community in general gathered to voice their disapproval of the pepper spraying of non-violent protestors on campus.  The photo here is unprocessed, but a stitched one will be coming soon!  The photo was taken with Stewart's helium balloon using a point-and-shoot camera and a smart phone took video of the crowd.  The crew: Stewart, Liz, Michele, and Alex.
