# BAP, fourth attempt a success.

Filled up the balloon for the fourth time and did a neighbors property.  This was shot with a canon Photoshot SD1200IS with CHDK and a 8' balloon off of ebay using helium as lift-gas.  The shoot was around sunset, so the shadows are long, but it was quite calm wind-wise and this is the first time I've been able to unwind my entire reel's worth of line.  I estimated about 1500ft in height is how far up we got.  Wind was blowing to the North, but only slightly and inconsistently.
