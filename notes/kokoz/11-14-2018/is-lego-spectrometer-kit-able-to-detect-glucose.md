# Is Lego Spectrometer Kit able to detect Glucose?

I'm trying to figure out how to detect Glucose using spectrophotometry in urine. There are some papers that describe very accurate readings using near-infrared spectrophotometry but as far as I understand it's measured between the 1300-2500nm wavelengths. I wonder if it's somehow achievable using the kit, perhaps with a different camera? 

  
Thoughts?  

  
Here are some papers I've read:
