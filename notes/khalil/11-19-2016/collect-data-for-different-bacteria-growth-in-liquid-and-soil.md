# collect data for different bacteria growth in liquid and soil

###What I want to do or know
I want to look at bacteria growth in water and so what will be a good sensor or methodology to test such thing.

###Background story
I want to collect data to be able to trace different bacteria existence in liquid and soil. Since I am just starting out on my new hobby to classify as many bacteria and be able to tell if some liquid is safe for consumption or if some soil is suitable for cultivation.
