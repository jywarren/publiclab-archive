# What is the spectral resolution of a Raspberry Pi camera spectrometer?

Hello, I have seen some activities on Public Lab on spectrometers using raspberry Pi camera, but I would like to find out about the spectral resolution that it can achieve.

This research article here [https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132212751.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132212751.pdf "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132212751.pdf") shows that raspberry pi camera can hit 1nm resolution, but this project only has a spectral bandwidth of 60nm in the UV region.

My questions are:

1\. Is there anyone who has the same success with raspberry pi camera spectrometer to get around 1nm resolution? If so, could I have the link please?

2\. Is it possible for the raspberry pi camera spectrometer to see the whole visible light spectrum while getting high spectral resolution?

3\. If so, could I replicate the design in the article and analyse the visible light spectrum instead, while getting good resolution?

Thank you! Sorry if I asked the wrong questions because I'm pretty new to spectroscopy.
