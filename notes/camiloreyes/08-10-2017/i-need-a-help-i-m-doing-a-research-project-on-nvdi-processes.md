# I need a help I'm doing a research project on NVDI processes

Good morning I am interested in the process making the software image conversion infrared, I have a question I have a camera nikon d5300 and let me know if I can use the investment process with that camera or any other that has technology DSLR, I want to know if I have to install a filter or make some modification, thanks for your help.

I am doing a montage of a drone with a camera to make infrared photos but the infrared camera is expensive but I want to use a professional or semi-professional camera to reduce costs and I also want to learn about the NDVI theme
