# Tutorial Connecting SpectralBench To IoT Datalogger?

###What I want to do or know
I am looking for a complete IoT (Internet of Things) step-by-step tutorial connecting and  using a solar powered or battery operated data logger for automating Spectral Work Bench in the cloud. In addition can you make the a data graph to overlay multiple  hourly or daily graph measurements of light wave readings.  

Spectral Bench currently displays one reading on the graph.  How can you make it display multiple reading of light wave measurements on one graph using an IoT device?
