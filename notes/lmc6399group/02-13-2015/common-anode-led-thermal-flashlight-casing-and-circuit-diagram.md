# Common-anode LED thermal flashlight casing and circuit diagram

A redrawn circuit diagram of the thermal flashlight described here: http://www.publiclab.org/wiki/thermal-camera

If you follow their materials list under Build Your Own > parts list, you will be purchasing a mini-breadboard with no power rails which does not match up to their diagram. This diagram provides support for a breadboard with no power rails.

The 3 separate pieces connected only by wire (battery, breadboard, arduino) can be cumbersome to use as a flashlight. Our guide at the bottom of [the page linked here](http://thermalflashlight.weebly.com/instructions.html) provides instructions to build an external casing that holds everything together as a single unit with only the LED and thermometer exposed. The case still provides easy access to the circuitry if needed.
