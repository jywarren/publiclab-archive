# Drone work with modified infrablue Canon a495

here are some photos of before and after processing with ned hornings plugin using fiji

i have had some very successful and non successful flights and finalized mosaics.

could anyone tell me why some photos respond very well to the plugin and some dont respond well whatsoever and produce little if not no coloration,
my input is that the timing of the photos taken are too early and the vines dont have enough foliage on them to output enough infrared light for the camera to pick up 

exactly the same camera and setup was used,
i cant guarantee that the white balance was the same, or other settings.


thanks
