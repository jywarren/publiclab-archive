# Hypersperctral imaging using DIY kits

A couple of years ago a friend showed me how a hyper spectral camera works. I cam to the realization such an instroment can be built very easily. I have noticed that when using the Public lab's mobile spectrometer it is possible to see variations in lighting when rotating the spectromter jig. I wish to share this project with others.

So far I have been able to mainly use this camera to produce images for fun and interest, I hope to be ale to use it in the future to detect objects based on thire spectral signiture.
I attach a link to the SW exe and source file. for the exe file first download LabVIEW runtime engine 2011. Several example files are attached.

SW and example image files can be found at:
[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwNVMC-VPEnTQWRtYUNGZ3JNeTQ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwNVMC-VPEnTQWRtYUNGZ3JNeTQ)
either download the "Build HSI.7z" or the folder under the same name.

Runtime engine can be dowloaded at:

Example video showing how to use the SW can be found at:

Further explenation on Hyper Spectral Imaging (HSI) and perliminary explenation on using the SW is found under the DIY HSI ppt file.
