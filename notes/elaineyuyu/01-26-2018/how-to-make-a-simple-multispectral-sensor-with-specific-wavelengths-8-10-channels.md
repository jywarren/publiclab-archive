# How to make a simple multispectral sensor with specific wavelengths (8-10 channels)?

Hi everyone, I am totally new here and not having technical background - we are trying to make a prototype multispectral imaging system to detect food fraud, there are specific wavelengths that we identified are most effective (in the 400-1000nm range) and trying to build a simple device to test them out. Is there a way to do that using the desktop spectrometry kit and some other simple equipments? Any help pointing me to the right direction would be very much appreciated!!
