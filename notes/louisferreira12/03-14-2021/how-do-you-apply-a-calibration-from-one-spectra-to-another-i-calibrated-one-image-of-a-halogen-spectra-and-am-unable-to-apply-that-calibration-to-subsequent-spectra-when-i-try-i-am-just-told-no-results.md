# How do you apply a calibration from one spectra to another? I calibrated one image of a halogen spectra, and am unable to apply that calibration to subsequent spectra, when i try i am just told "No Results"

I have calibrated one image of a spectrum from a halogen lamp, but when i attempt to apply this calibration to another upload, no option appears for me to apply that calibration to this new picture. When i click "copy calibration" i am told there are "no results"
