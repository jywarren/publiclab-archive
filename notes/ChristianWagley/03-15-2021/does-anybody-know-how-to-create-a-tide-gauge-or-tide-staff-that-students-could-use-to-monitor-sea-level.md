# Does anybody know how to create a tide gauge or tide staff that students could use to monitor sea level?

I'm in Pensacola, FL and looking to engage students on climate science as a way to help build support for climate action by our city government. There is a NOAA tide gauge on our downtown waterfront that has been measuring sea level since the mid-1920s, but I am looking for a way for students to do some daily monitoring of sea level as a way of learning about tides and then comparing their current readings to historic changes in sea level. I need to know what equipment we would need and how to install. Thanks!!!
