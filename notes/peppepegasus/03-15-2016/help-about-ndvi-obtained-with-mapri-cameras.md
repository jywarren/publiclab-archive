# Help about NDVI obtained with Mapir cameras.

Hi guys, it is the first time I write on Publiclab.
With my group we are investigatiing on the use of Mapir camera. We have 2 cameras: red and nir. We want to build a NDVI map and we used the raster calculator of QGis.
Can someone help me if the results are good or are bad?

My principal doubt is about the sky: it seems to have a good vegetation index. Any idea?
Any help is apreciated.
