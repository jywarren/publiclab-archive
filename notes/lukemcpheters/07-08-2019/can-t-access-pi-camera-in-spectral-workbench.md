# Can't access pi camera in Spectral Workbench

I've tried Firefox and Chrome, Windows and Linux, on two different laptops. Can't get my camera to show up as a selectable option. The only available option is the laptops built-in camera. I can access the pi camera through pi.local and it works fine, just not through Spectral Workbench. No idea where to go from here i don't see anything on the site that talks about this issue, any advice is appreciated.
