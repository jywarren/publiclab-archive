# Paper size for stiff matte black card insert

###What I want to do or know
What paper size should I be printing out the design file provided in this page (under the title 'Design files')?

###Background story
I am trying to rebuild the 2.0 DSK using the metal enclosure; but, I have misplaced the insert card and want to reprint one or even build one using black foam board.
Any and all help will be much appreciated.
