# Unable to use back camera on an android phone

###What I want to do or know
I am building a spectrometer using my android phone but I am unable to use the back camera when using the chrome browser. 
###Background story
I am using a Nexus 5.
When I go to spectral workbench on my browser it always uses the front camera.
