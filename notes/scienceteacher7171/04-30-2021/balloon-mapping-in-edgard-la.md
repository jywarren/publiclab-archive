# Balloon Mapping In Edgard, LA

WSJH students learned how to capture aerial views with balloon mapping. Pictures were taken of our research  site using Public Labs Balloon Mapping kit. This was the first time students had exposure to balloon kit, Public Labs representative Purl visited our school to conduct a session with the students on how to use the balloon to capture aerial shots. ![image description](/i/43619.jpg "thumbnail_IMG_3854.jpg")
