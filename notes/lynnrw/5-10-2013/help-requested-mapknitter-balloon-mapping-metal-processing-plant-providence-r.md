# Help requested with mapknitter- Balloon mapping of Metal processing plant in Providence, RI

We're a neighborhood group in East Providence, RI with houses adjacent  to a large construction waste grinding business. Toxic dust was filtering into our homes and yards  from the plant.   Many in the neighborhood suffer from respiratory and other health problems  thought to be associated with the dust.

We managed ( with Toxic Action Center's  help)  to have the waste grinding stopped. However, the same business owner re-opened the plant without a permit -only this time as a scrap metal processing operation. The Balloon mapping  that we did  on March 30,2013  was to document the activity on the property after the waste grinding stopped and the unpermitted  metal processing  started. Still trying to get authorities to take some action or over site of the property.  We'd appreciate any help to piece together the pictures which are in uploaded to Mapmill. Thanks
