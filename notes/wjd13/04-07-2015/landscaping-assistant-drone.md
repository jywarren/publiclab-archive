# Landscaping Assistant Drone

A friend and I are building a drone as a high school project. We want to use it to fly around outside a house, and measure the health of the plants in the yard. So far we've done a lot of research, and ordered some preliminary parts. One problem we have is finding the right sensors to measure plant health. Can anyone explain how the Infragram camera works, and if it might work in this situation? Thanks very much, and we will keep you updated on the drone's progress! :)
