# A Day in the Life of LDI

During the development process, we add a lot of gifs on our PRs to better document the changes we implement. I figured rather than writing about developments in LDI, I can use the gifs to show them.

Due to file size restrictions - here is a very small hype video made of a compilation of some of the gifs created by the PL development team along the way.

This pocket size clip highlights some of the features recently created, and still in creation, by the Leaflet.DistortableImage and Mapknitter development team (2019). All of the developers have a lot of fun working on these features and collaborating with each other.
