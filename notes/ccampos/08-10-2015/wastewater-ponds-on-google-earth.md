The images above are google earth images of produced wastewater ponds.  In Kern County California, we have used these images to formally request action about these ponds from the Regional Water Quality Control Board.  Runoff from these ponds has the potential to contaminate surface and groundwater.  Furthermore, air emissions from these ponds are not highly regulated and permit voc emissions that harm air quality.
