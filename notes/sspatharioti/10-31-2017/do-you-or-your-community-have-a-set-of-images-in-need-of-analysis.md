# Do you or your community have a set of images in need of analysis? 

We are developing a free and open source website for communities to collectively analyze images called Cartoscope. So far it's been used for looking at algal blooms and damage from disasters. If you have an image set you think it might be useful to have a crowd help analyze, we can set up a project and work on them as an activity. So bring your images on a flash drive or share a dropbox link for us to work on setting things up. This will also help us get feedback for our tool.
