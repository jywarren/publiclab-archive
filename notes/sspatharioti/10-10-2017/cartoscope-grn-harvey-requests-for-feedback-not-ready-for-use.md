# Cartoscope GRN Harvey: Requests for feedback -- not ready for use

# Harvey Response: Oil Sheen Identification using Cartoscope

Responding to a request by the Gulf Restoration Network for identifying oil sheens in aerial images, we created a project on Cartoscope, an open-sourced crowdsourcing tool for analyzing images using various types of tasks such as image labeling.

You can follow the project [here](http://cartosco.pe/#kioskProject/u8X4YTFQHpmn).

As this is still a work in progress, please **do not publicly share the link until it is ready for use**.
