# Who has used vehicles as mobile sensor platforms?

I've been wondering for several years how I could build a ambient/environmental sensor platform to collect various kinds of data.  I live in a rural area and tried to count road-kill in order to find distribution patterns. This is probably a tall order for a car-mounted sensor, but surely there would be a use for really granular weather data for climate research, air quality data... what else?  When I must drive, I'd like to make it as useful as possible.  A caveat - I'm an enthusiast, not an electrical engineer.  

  
Glad to hear thoughts of the community on line, or you can contact me directly at waugh2k@gmail.com.
