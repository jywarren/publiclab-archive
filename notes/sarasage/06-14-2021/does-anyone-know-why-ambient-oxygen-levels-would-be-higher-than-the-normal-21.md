# Does anyone know why ambient oxygen levels would be higher than the normal 21%?

I got 23% O2 readings today (two different monitors) and want to know if this is considered within the normal range? There was also elevated NH3 today.  Also, does temperature affect O2 concentrations? Genuinely curious.
