# Getting GPS in Remote Locations

###Hello! 

I am planning on doing field sampling and would like to be able to obtain exact GPS coordinates in a remote location where there is no cell phone service.

I need to mark exact coordinates for sampling locations so resulting data can be mapped.

Is there an easy workaround for this problem? Alternatively, an inexpensive, off-the-shelf product that can be purchased?
