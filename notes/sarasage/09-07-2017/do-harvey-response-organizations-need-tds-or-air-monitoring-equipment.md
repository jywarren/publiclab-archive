# Do Harvey response organizations need TDS or air monitoring equipment?

Besides the initial damage from the hurricane and the flooding, there are concerning reports regarding releases from chemical plants and refineries that were damaged during Harvey in the Houston area. Is there a need for monitoring resources and is there a team in place to help with sampling?

  
Also, what efforts are regulatory agencies and other nonprofit orgs doing to solve the data deficit in this regard?
